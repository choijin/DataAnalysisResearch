<AbstractNarration>The main objective of this project is to develop advanced computational (ab-initio) tools that bridge the gap between the existing complex theories that describe the behavior of strongly-correlated electron materials, and the scientists working in other diverse fields who want to investigate the physical properties of the strongly correlated materials using modern state-of-the-art computational methodologies. These strongly-correlated materials show a large set of interesting properties that can impact different fields as in opto-catalysis, magneto-optics, magneto-transport, high temperature superconductivity and magneto-electricity. The intriguing properties of such strongly-correlated materials includes unconventional superconductivity, complex charge spin and orbital ordering, metal-to-insulator transitions, and excellent thermoelectricity that have promising applications in modern technology. The existence of strong electron-electron interactions limits the use of existing Density Functional Theory (DFT) to understand the electronic structure of the strongly-correlated materials. However, recent developments of a new theory, named Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT), has enabled researchers to correctly describe the electronic structure of the strongly correlated materials. In this project, the PIs will develop advanced Python-based computational research tools that will enable the researchers from diverse fields to investigate the properties of the strongly-correlated materials using DMFT. The specific applications include -- correct prediction of the electronic structure, vibrational properties and elastic properties of the strongly-correlated materials. The developed software tools will be freely available and open source and a user-manual will be made available for training purposes.&lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The main goal of this project is to provide end users of various electronic structure codes with a flexible Python-based interface that does not rely on the extensive user experience or specific parameters to perform calculations for strongly-correlated materials and to develop new software to calculate electronic, vibrational, and elastic properties of strongly-correlated materials by using Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) methods starting from a Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculation. The developed software tools will be powerful enough to allow scientists in different fields to calculate the diverse electronic properties of a wide range of strongly-correlated materials with the state-of-the-art computational methodologies. Furthermore, these software packages will allow the correct electronic structure calculations in a minimal set of parameters, by offering to the end user the possibility of using three different methodologies to describe basic physics of strongly-correlated materials. All the developed computer software will be designed to enable the non-expert materials scientists and engineers to investigate the novel properties of the strongly-correlated materials. The scientific aim of this project also concerns the evolution of electronic correlations for several complex oxinitrides and Heusler alloys, in particular the dependence of several physical observables with respect to external fields such as pressure and strain. Targeted physical properties include electronic, vibrational, and elastic. The technical goal consists of the development of an open-source software that will address the scientific issues raised by the research on calculating properties of the strongly-correlated materials.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is supported by the Office of Advanced Cyberinfrastructure in the Directorate for Computer &amp; Information Science and Engineering and the Division of Materials Research in the Directorate of Mathematical and Physical Sciences.</AbstractNarration>

Our DMFTwDFT code and existing automated script introduce a novel platform for accelerating material discovery and design by empowering our methods to describe strongly correlated materials' electronic and dynamical properties accurately.  Some of our key results are outlined:     Development of the DMFTwDFT framework: The deployment and maintenance of a complete open-source package alongside Fortran and C++ routines wrapped with Python scripts to run DFT+DMFT self-consistent calculations and perform postprocessing to obtain analytic continuation of the self-energy, orbital/atom projected DMFT bandstructure with direct DFT comparison, partial DOS plots, self-energy and Green's functions plots through fully automated scripts.

Development of the DMFTwDFT library mode:  While our package is self-contained, we have also created a library mode that enables convenient interfacing between DMFTwDFT and other DFT codes to achieve full charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT calculations.   Implementation of the force calculation within DFT+DMFT: This allows us to obtain the interatomic forces within DFT+DMFTincluding the change of Wannier orbitals upon structural distortions using the finite-difference method. This implementation will be helpful to study the thermal properties of strongly correlated materials.  Self-consistent Hubbard U calculation. The U parameter is anecessary input in the DFT+U theory, used to describe strongly correlated materials at the DFT level.  Enhancements to the PyProcar package that works as a pre-processing and postprocessing tool for DMFT calculations. Enhancements to the PyChemia framework which facilitates generating inputs for DMFT calculations. Improvement of the DMFTwDFT documentation following feedback from current users for better clarity and worked examples. This can be found at https://dmftwdft-project.github.io/DMFTwDFT/. Implementation of Virtual Crystal Approximation (VCA) within DMFT. A method used to study alloys by creating virtual atoms as a combination of the alloying elements.   Application of DMFTwDFT code to solve many correlated problems that include rare-earth metals with strongly correlated f-electrons and molecular conformation effect in magnetic molecules. Effect os magnetic orgering in several oxide perovskites were studied, where correlations can enhance the present of one of the magnetic phases.
