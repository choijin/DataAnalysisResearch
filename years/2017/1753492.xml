<AbstractNarration>Subduction is a fundamental tectonic process that shapes the Earth's physical and chemical evolution and has many important potential human impacts, including seismic and volcanic hazards, as well as mineral resources, which are common products of subduction magmatism.  As a result, subduction-related processes are the subject of broad public interest and widespread investigation in the geosciences. Despite almost a century of research on the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system, several key questions remain unanswered including how and when the subduction zone was formed and to what extent the subducting Pacific plate contributes to the creation of magma generated beneath Alaska-Aleutian volcanoes. This project will allow a group of U.S. scientists from the University of South Carolina and the University of Wisconsin-Madison to precisely determine the timing of Aleutian arc formation and to characterize the products that are entering and have erupted from this active volcanic arc. This is a collaborative effort involving graduate and undergraduate students, post-docs, and researchers from Germany, Russia and the United States. All data from this project will be made available to the public. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The project has two broadly related themes: 1) Constraining the timing of subduction initiation and early evolution of the Aleutian arc, and 2) Characterizing subduction inputs to both the Aleutian and Kamchatka arcs and relating them to the processes controlling arc magma formation. Analyses of samples from Expedition SO249 of the German R/V Sonne as part of the German-Russian BERING project will provide constraints on the timing of Aleutian arc formation and the geochemistry of the early arc products. The project will also obtain geochemical data for north Pacific seafloor samples adjacent to the western Aleutian arc, including sites both east and west of the northern Emperor seamounts. This study will help better understand geochemical linkages between subduction input and volcanic output, and will provide new constraints and significantly improve models of arc magma genesis for the Aleutians and Kamchatka.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This project was a collaborative effort between U.S., German, and Russian scientists to constrain the timing of the early Aleutian volcanic arc and characterize the material that will be subducted beneath this arc in the future. Using 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, 60 new dates were obtained from early Aleutian arc volcanic and plutonic rocks. These data, coupled with new geochemical and isotopic data obtained by German colleagues, collectively suggest that initiation of the western Aleutian arc is older than initiation of western Pacific arcs at 51-52 Ma. Thus, the entire sequence of tectonic events in the circum-Pacific from 60 to 45 million years ago needs to be completely re-evaluated. In addition, the geodynamic models for this region and this time period also need to be significantly revised. Data obtained in this project also provide a detailed characterization of the volcanic products from the Aleutian arc since it initiated. Another significant outcome of the project has to do with the volcanic products that were sampled on the Pacific Plate. Volcanism on the seafloor is commonly associated with subduction, a mantle plume, or mid-ocean ridges. New data obtained in this project suggest that there may be significant seafloor volcanism when large segments of a tectonic plate are being deformed. This may cause volcanism on other tectonic plates to be re-evaluated.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 02/16/2021<br>      Modified by: Brian&nbsp;Jicha</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
