<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the travel expenses of participants in the conference "Applications of Model Theory to Operator Algebras" that will be held from July 31 - August 4, 2017, on the campus of the University of Houston, Houston, Texas.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This conference will focus on important recent developments in the use of model theory of operator algebras and the applications of mathematical logic to classification problems in operator algebras. The goals of this conference are to inform non-experts and young researchers of the fundamental concepts of this version of model theory and to update experts who work in other areas of operator algebras of the latest advances. This will be accomplished by a series of five featured lectures by Israel Farah and other plenary research talks presented by a mixture of experienced and junior researchers. The featured lectures will be accessible to all graduate students and non-experts with a basic knowledge of functional analysis and operator algebras. This meeting will provide a special opportunity for early career mathematicians to learn about these recent developments at the interface of logic and set theory and operator algebras. Special attention will be given to ensure the participation of members of underrepresented groups in the conference. The conference will have significant impact on the future of the field of operator algebras and to will broaden and influence the work of junior investigators in this area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project involved hosting a conference and small workshop.  The conference, entitled "Applications of Model Theory to Operator Algebras" brought together researchers from two different areas of mathematics: Logic and Operator Algebras.  In recent years techniques from mathematical logic have been used to settle many long-standing problems about operator algebras and initiate new lines of research in operator algebra theory.   The major goals of this conference were to advance research in the subject; to provide a forum for experts (from multiple areas) and nonexperts to discuss mathematical problems and thereby increase collaboration (especially among the many diverse researchers and institutions in the region); to expose young people and beginners to cutting edge mathematical research and have the opportunity to interact with the mathematical community and develop mathematically and professionally.    With funds remaining  after the conference, we hosted a small workshop on the topic of Cuntz-Pimsner algebras, a particular class of C*-algebras that have recently experienced a renaissance in the study of operator algebras.  In the past fifteen years, Cuntz-Pimsner algebras have received increasing attention from the operator algebra and noncommutative geometry communities, leading many mathematicians to investigate their properties from several perspectives. The purpose of this workshop was to bring together researchers who have developed distinct viewpoints on Cuntz-Pimsner algebras in order to share ideas and promote collaboration.  In addition, we chose the participants of the workshop to be young researchers (typically, tenure-track professors that had not yet received tenure) from different specialties within the study of operator algebras, in order to support the beginning careers of these young researchers and facilitate collaborations that otherwise may not have occurred.
