<AbstractNarration>This award supports a planning workshop towards assessing industrial interest in the research agenda of the Ohio State University (OSU) as a potential site addition to the NSF funded Industry University Cooperative Research Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations. The OSU Site's primary goals are to expand the center?s understanding of the causal pathways that result in musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) and produce recurrent injuries and to translate this knowledge into useful tools that can be easily applied for prevention.  This will be accomplished through multidisciplinary research efforts that use engineering techniques to understand and prevent MSDs, guided by industry advisors, that focus on:  identifying sources of work-related back pain and other MSDs; preventing these injuries through innovative intervention techniques; and evaluating and treating those who have developed an MSD so that they can safely return to work.  The OSU team?s  biomechanical models will enable evaluation of  how physical exposures, individual factors, and psychosocial influences interact to load soft tissues and change biochemical responses within the musculoskeletal system that contribute to employee pain, injury potential, and disability.  These efforts will complement the work of the existing Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations and its overall mission to improve MSD therapies and treatments.  This will create a more-holistic, systematic approach to injury prevention (the most cost-effective means to reduce healthcare costs) and assist in improving the management and quality of life of those suffering from low back disorders and other musculoskeletal diseases.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Treating those suffering from a musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) is costly.  These soft tissue sprains/strains account for about one-third of all workplace injuries or illnesses, more than any other.  Of all MSDs, low back disorders (LBDs) themselves affect 80% of the population and cost society about $100 billion annually.  They are the most disabling type of injury, responsible for approximately 100 million lost workdays, and U.S. employers spend about $30 billion each year just to treat employee back pain.  Thus, preventing these health issues is vital and the logical step to reduce injuries and help solve this nation?s healthcare crisis.  However, the causes of these injuries often are complex, multi-factorial, and poorly understood.  So, researchers at this Site (guided by industry advisors) will address important MSD concerns, by applying our sophisticated analysis techniques to better understand the causal pathways by which individuals become injured.  Our Site will complement an existing Center that focuses on improving MSD treatments, to form a more-comprehensive, systematic injury prevention process.  Researchers and students working within this Site will develop and apply enhanced engineering techniques to improve the health and lives of individuals as well as make companies more prosperous and competitive in the global market.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES  The objective of this project was to develop and conduct a meeting to plan for a new Site addition to an existing IUCRC, the Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations (CDMI).  The CDMI focuses on advancing knowledge to develop innovative medical technologies to improve human health.  The aim of this newly proposed Site is to complement the CDMI by expanding our understanding of the causal pathways for musculoskeletal disorder (MSD) development.  This would be accomplished through industry partnerships with our University?s researchers and practitioners who specialize in identifying causes of work-related low back pain and other MSDs, preventing these injuries through innovative intervention techniques, and evaluating and treating those who have developed an MSD so that they can safely return to work.     PROJECT ACTIVITIES  Prior to this meeting, we held discussions with various industry representatives, to initially gauge the types of MSD prevention research efforts they believed would be of most benefit to them.  Their comments loosely fell into three categories of increased knowledge on:  the impact of physical load factors (the physical workplace exposures that contribute to MSDs); pathomechanics (biomechanical changes in the body?s soft tissues due to work and its impact on MSD development); and organizational influences (how the workplace environment contributes to and interacts with physical workloads to impact injury development).  From this feedback, researchers developed more than one dozen precompetitive research project proposals.  The Site Planning meeting was held on the campus of The Ohio State University, in Columbus Ohio, on September 19th 20th  2017.  It was attended by:  Twelve (12) industry representatives from a wide and diverse variety of business interests (e.g., automotive, aerospace, warehousing, insurance), safety &amp; health organizations with close ties to industry, and the military; Four (4) individuals from the National Science Foundation and CDMI; and Twenty two (22) academic researchers, staff, and graduate students from across the University, who represented the Office of Research, the Colleges of Engineering, Medicine, and Public Health, and the Departments of Industrial &amp; Systems Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Biomedical Engineering, Materials Science, Health &amp; Rehabilitation Sciences, and Aviation.   During the two-day meeting, researchers presented 14 research proposals, the titles of which are shown in Figure 1.  After each presentation, industry representatives completed an online Level of Interest and Feedback Evaluation (LIFE) form, to gauge their interest in the research and ask questions of the researchers.  These results were tabulated to determine which projects these individuals would most prefer to move forward should the Site receive funding.  The top four are noted with an asterisk (*) in Figure 1.    During the meeting, discussions also were held with industry to determine how to change or refine our initially proposed major research thrusts.  The portion of the Site planning meeting was invaluable.  As a result, the major research thrusts were modified and expanded to those described below:  Physical Exposures for Primary Injury (i.e., the physical workplace factors that contribute to an initial MSD, with emphasis on back and shoulder injuries, conditions that impact musculoskeletal fatigue, methods to determine the impact of interventions aimed to reduce MSD development, and more-comprehensive MSD risk assessments); Exposures for Secondary Injury (i.e., the conditions under which employees with a musculoskeletal disease are able to either return to work successfully or relapse to a second or chronic MSD); and Organizational and Individual Factors Related to MSD Development (i.e., how work organization, the work environment, and employee attributes, such as aging, contribute to and interact with physical workloads to influence injury development).   OUTCOMES  The following activities have occurred since our September 2017 Site Planning meeting:  We have had meetings with a number of industries regarding their interests in pursuing some of the topics that were presented and discussed.  We find this to be very encouraging for a dynamic and enthusiastic Industry Advisory Board (IAB); We submitted a Site addition pre-proposal on October 18th, 2017 (NSF Proposal Number 1803258), and received an "encourage" response on November 20th, 2017; and We submitted a full proposal to become a Site addition to the existing IUCRC (CDMI) on December 20th, 2017 (Phase I IUCRC The Ohio State University: Center for Disruptive Musculoskeletal Innovations, NSF Proposal Number 1822124).
