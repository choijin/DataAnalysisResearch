<AbstractNarration>The proposed work involves purchase of ten (10), new model, high-temperature (high-T), deepsea hydrothermal vent fluid loggers for use in short- and long-term deployments by scientists in the US oceanographic community involved in Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI), International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP), National Deep Submergence Facility (NDSF) and NSF-EAR research programs. These vent fluid loggers have been developed and improved upon over the past 25 years by the PI and WHOI engineers through the WHOI-MISO Facility (http://www.whoi.edu/miso). These instruments have provided the longest time series records of mid-ocean ridge (MOR) hydrothermal vent fluid temperatures, and key information that enhances understanding of hydrothermal fluid flow processes, linkages to magmatism and tectonism at mid-ocean ridge study sites, and shallow ocean crustal permeability. The new model MISO high-T loggers are now manufactured by EP Oceanographic, LLC (EPO), an oceanographic instrumentation company in Pocasset, MA (USA), as part of a collaborative effort to develop small-business innovation and transfer new technologies and ideas needed for oceanographic research to the private sector.</AbstractNarration>
