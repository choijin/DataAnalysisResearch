<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Sixth Cornell Conference on Analysis, Probability, and Mathematical Physics on Fractals" that will be held June 13-17, 2017, on the campus of Cornell University. For additional information see the conference website: http://www.math.cornell.edu/~fractals/ .&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This triennial conference series, the first event in which took place in 2002 and of which the 2017 meeting will be the sixth installment, is one of the major conferences whose focus is on mathematics on fractal sets. Topics to be discussed range from harmonic analysis to probability, from number theory to stochastic analysis. The long list of keynote speakers at the 2017 conference includes the names of most of the world's leading researchers in the field. The program allows ample opportunity for early-career mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>
