<AbstractNarration>Wearable health monitoring systems offer tremendous potential to improve our lives, yet a number of hurdles must be cleared before they become a reality. The processors and architectures that enable this technology demand a large amount of energy, requiring sizable batteries. The ultimate objective of this CAREER research is to create programmable architectures which require no battery and can rely on energy harvesting techniques. To achieve this objective, we seek to reduce power consumption of the processing units by more than two orders of magnitude.  This power reduction is accomplished through novel, transformative methodologies to compose and configure programmable, ultra low power, granular decision-making architectures. New algorithms, tightly coupled with signal processing for power reduction in communication blocks are investigated. Research methods to activate and deactivate sensors with the granular decision making architecture attempts to further reduce the power consumption. The methodologies are validated and refined using two clinical case studies.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project has the potential to dramatically improve the quality of health monitoring practice and medical research, empowering numerous applications that are not currently feasible. Growing demand for health care monitoring applications requires students, engineers and health care professionals to design, develop, deploy and operate wearable systems. This project provides a multidisciplinary platform to realize the educational objectives of developing wearable computers, involving high school students and teachers as well as undergraduate and graduate students. Outreach programs are offered through short courses and lectures to local undergraduate societies (SWE, Honors and IEEE), K-12 students, health-care professionals, and local industries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Detection of activities of daily living (ADL) is vital to identify health and behavior anomalies and detect early onset of diseases. Wearable sensors provide the opportunity to capture both fine grained activities as well as long term behavioral trends. There are however challenges associated with the battery life, size of the sensors as well the accuracy of detecting activities. This project addresses all aforementioned technical gaps.  The project produced a suite of ultra-low power architectures that can detect ADL with a very small amount of energy. The significant power saving was achieved by performing a preliminary ultra low-power signal processing and hence, keeping the main processor off when the incoming signal is not of interest.  In ADL recognition using wearable sensors, information about the confidence/uncertainty of the recognition system is essential to design active learning paradigms that can adaptively modify themselves to learn complex activities on-the-fly through asking for userâ€™s feedback. With this paradigm, the system needs to recognize the data points for which it cannot produce decisions with high confidence to minimize interaction and the burden on the user. The project created a suite of algorithms for activity recognition that produced aleatoric (data dependent) and epistemic (model dependent) uncertainties in the recognition task.  Finally, current systems using wearables are not capable of understanding their surroundings, which limits their sensing capabilities. For instance, distinguishing certain activities such as attending a meeting or class, which have similar motion patterns but happen in different contexts, is challenging by only using wearable motion sensors. This project further focused on understanding userâ€™s surroundings, i.e., environmental context, to enhance capability of wearables, with focus on detecting complex ADL, and created a suite of context-aware algorithms for ADL.
