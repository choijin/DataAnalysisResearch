<AbstractNarration>This award funds Student Travel Fellowships for US students attending PETS 2017, the 2017 Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium. The Student Fellowships helps cover the travel expenses for these students, making it possible for them to attend the symposium and participate in the discussions of recent advances and new perspectives related to the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The PETS symposium brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world and presents a valuable opportunity for researchers to share their result and learn about the state of the art in privacy.  Participation in the conference can be an important part of the graduate-school or college experience of the sponsored students, providing them the opportunity to interact with peers and more senior researchers, thus having the opportunity to be exposed to leading edge work in privacy.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[    The Privacy Enhancing Technology Symposium (PETS), established in 2000, brings together privacy and anonymity experts from around the world to discuss recent advances and new perspectives. PETS addresses the design and realization of privacy services for the Internet and other data systems and communication networks. The 2017 edition of PETS was held at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis from July 18 - July 21, 2017; this project broadened student participation in the field by providing travel support for US students who would otherwise have been unable to attend PETS 2017.  In total, the project provided support for 21 students to attend the symposium; these students were selected according to their potential contirbutions to the privacy resaerch community by a committee of four senior researchers and allocated funds based on need.  These students had the opportunity to network with peers, interact with leading researchers in the field of privacy enhancing technologies, and attend and engage with presentations of leading edge research in privacy.  It is expected that these opportunities will lead to increased collaborations and research contributions in the future.   The project helped to broaden participation in computing by supporting seven students from under-represented groups.  Furthermore, nine of the supported students had the opportunity to present their research results at the symposium or the associated HotPETs workshop, allowing them to receive valuable feedback on their work.
