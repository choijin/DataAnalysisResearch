<AbstractNarration>This award provides funding to help defray the expenses of participants in the "Rocky Mountain Partial Differential Equations Conference" that will be held May 18 and 19, 2017, on the campus of Brigham Young University. For additional information see the conference website: https://math.byu.edu/pde/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This regional conference will focus on a range of topics, both pure and applied, within the field of partial differential equations (PDE). One purpose of the conference is to create a network of PDE specialists in the Rocky Mountain region that will promote research collaborations. The program will feature two plenary speakers (Edriss Titi, Daniela De Silva), each of whom will deliver an hour-long lecture. The program allows ample opportunity for junior mathematicians to present their work.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Rocky Mountain Partial Differential Equations (PDE) Conference was held at Provo, UT on May 18-19, 2017.  This conference brought individuals together whose research is in PDEs, and are in a nearby geographical region (primarily located in or near the Rocky Mountains).  The conference achieved two main goals: 1)  disseminate recent advances in the analysis and application of partial differential equations, and 2)  create networking opportunities for scientists at all levels in the Rocky Mountain region including students, with particular attention being paid to under-represented groups.   The number of conference participants totaled approximately 50 individuals. The conference had 6 invited talks and 13 contributed talks. In addition the conference had a poster session.     Intellecutal Merit:  The conference focused on different physical, economic and social phenomena modeled by the use of partial differential equations. Presentations included research on the modeling of a given system as well as the analysis of models. The analysis and research on models given by differential equations benefits both the sciences and engineering. The research in this area, ranging from pure to applied, is extremely broad, with many active groups. This conference facilitated this interaction by bringing together groups from theoretical mathematics, applied mathematics, and engineering. Participants at the conference included engineers. The main presentations, as well as many of the contributed talks, focused not only on obtained results but also on open problems and unstudied models. Speakers presented many models important to the physical sciences and engineering for which many mathematical results are still unknown.      Broader Impacts:  The conference shared recent advances in the analysis and application of partial differential equations, and created networking opportunities for scientists at all levels in the Rocky mountain region, including students, with particular attention to underrepresented groups. Members of under-represented groups participated in giving plenary talks, contributed talks, and presenting in a poster session. Half of the invited speakers were from underrepresented groups.  The NSF grant provided travel and lodging funds for 24 participants, and over a third of such participants belong to underrepresented groups. The conference also sought to help junior researchers by providing opportunities to disseminate results. Presenters at the conference included graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, as well as senior researchers. The conference also provided networking and speaking opportunities for researchers and students from teaching institutions.
