<AbstractNarration>A central endeavor of theoretical computer science is to classify computational problems according to the resources (such as running time and storage space) needed to solve them.  Although the field of algorithm design has been highly successful in discovering efficient, polynomial-time algorithms for problems of practical interest, little evidence has been shown for the optimality of most algorithms.  The goal of this project is to build a useful complexity theory for the class of polynomial-time solvable problems (called P), by proving equivalences between problems and proving conditional lower bounds on specific problems, assuming the validity of certain plausible mathematical conjectures.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Known lower bounds for specific problems in P are conditioned on some complexity-theoretic assumption such as the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis (concerning the complexity of k-CNF-SAT), the conjecture that dense all-pairs shortest paths (APSP) requires cubic time, or that 3SUM requires quadratic time.  The goals of this project are threefold.  The first goal is to establish conditional lower bounds on problems in diverse areas (such as graph optimization, string matching, geometry, and dynamic data structures) using standard hardness conjectures. The second goal is to search for better hardness conjectures that are both plausible and versatile, and to discover relationships (implications or equivalences) between nominally unrelated conjectures.  The last goal is to investigate the plausibility of these conjectures by attempting to disprove them.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The curricular portion of this project involves developing lecture material suitable for introductory algorithms and complexity courses at both the undergraduate and graduate level.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ One of the great successes of theoretical computer science is classifying problems as tractable (traditionally solvable in polynomial time, i.e. in the complexity class P) or intractable (typically NP-hard).  In today’s world of large data however, even low polynomial time such as cubic or quadratic time may be intractable. A new theory of hardness, fine-grained complexity aims to differentiate problems whose best running times grow as n, n^2, n^3, etc. in terms of the input size n, and to understand the relationships between problems via reductions. The goal of this project is to further develop this theory and to apply it in new ways.      This grant supported the organization of two workshops on this topic, Structure and Hardness in P in 2016 and and Fine-Grained Approximation Algorithms and Complexity in 2019, which helped popularize and accelerate research in this exciting field. To further help the research area and expose beginning researchers to the topics, the PI wrote several surveys and lists of open problems, most recently in 2018 and 2019.      NP-hardness is based on the widely believed but unproven assumption that P does not equal NP.

The main three hardness hypotheses are the 3SUM Hypothesis that the 3SUM problem requires n^{2-o(1)} time, the APSP Hypothesis that All-Pairs Shortest Paths (APSP) requires n^{3-o(1)} time and the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) that Boolean k-Satisfiability requires 2^{n-o(n)} time.  We have proven that the current fastest algorithms for a variety of basic problems are optimal if one assumes SETH: Deciding whether a given rooted tree is a subtree of another requires n^{2-o(1)} time under SETH, and can also be solved in O(n^2) time. The Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem for two n-length sequences, whose O(n^2) time algorithm is taught in undergraduate classes as a classic example of dynamic programming, requires n^{2-o(1)} time under SETH.
