<AbstractNarration>This 3-year SHINE project is aimed at gaining a comprehensive understanding of the physical connection between small-scale physical processes at magnetic reconnection sites in the solar atmosphere and the evolution of solar eruptions at greater scales.  This, the project has the potential to significantly advance knowledge of the energy release process in solar eruptions.  In particular, the project will explore the relationship between small-scale energy release in the form of outflows in the current sheet region and the large-scale transport of thermal energy in the flare structure.  The integrated modeling efforts will form the basis of the development of a more sophisticated, full three-dimensional (3-D) simulation of solar eruptions in the future.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 3-year research program integrates two sets of well-developed, state-of-the-art magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations:  one simulation models the large-scale structure and evolution of solar flares, whereas the other simulation targets detailed dynamics in and around the reconnection current sheet region at small scales.  The large-scale flare simulation will be used to set up the context and initial conditions for the detailed full 3-D simulation of the reconnection region.  The outputs of the detailed small scale 3-D simulation, in turn, will provide feedback and update the large-scale simulation to evaluate the consequences of small-scale energy release processes.  The modeling results will be compared with extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and X-ray observations to test and improve our understanding of the energy release and conversion processes from small to large scales.  A variety of well observed, but poorly understood phenomena that are closely tied to the energy release processes will be investigated and compared to model outputs, including supra-arcade down-flows and other fast plasma outflows, current-sheet like structures above flare loops, and hot loop-top EUV/X-ray sources.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The improved knowledge on the origin of solar eruptions is critical to understand basic science needed to meet the goals of the National Space Weather Strategy and Action Plan, which aims to develop tools to forecast space weather and mitigate its impacts.  The project team will involve students in this SHINE research through the established CfA's Solar Physics Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program.  These students come from a wide variety of backgrounds, including traditionally underrepresented groups in the sciences.  Thus, the research and EPO agenda of this project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project is to gain a comprehensive understanding of solar eruptions by studying the connection between small-scale physics and the evolution of eruptions at greater scales.  In this work, we have found an explanation for dark structures observed flowing towards the Sun during solar flares.  According to our research, these structures are caused by an instability that occurs when two fluids of different density are impulsively accelerated by the passage of a shock wave.  The shock wave is caused by the sudden, violent reconfiguring of magnetic fields that powers the eruption.  This interpretation upsets the previous wisdom regarding these dark downflows, which held that they were plasma flows originating directly from the reconfiguration, rather than the shock wave.  A paper on this research is being prepared, and will be submitted to Science.  This research has also yielded observational discoveries.  We find observational evidence for oscillations in the region above the magnetic loops formed by a solar flare observed on September 10, 2017.  Similar oscillations in other events have been interpreted as standing waves (a wave which oscillates in time but whose peak amplitude profile does not move in space).  However, our results show that the frequencies of the oscillations we observe do not depend on the length of the magnetic loop, a necessity for standing waves.  Instead, we interpret these observations as evidence for a "magnetic tuning fork" model, where the magnetic field is energized by a rebounding of the plasma flow initiated by the violent magnetic reconfiguration that causes the flare.  This energization causes the magnetic field to vibrate, similar to a tuning fork.  This research has been accepted for publication in The Astrophysical Journal.  In terms of broader impacts of this research, we note that over the course of this project, three students were trained in data analysis methods in solar astronomy. Two of them come from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences.  Two of the three have gone on to graduate school, and the third is contemplating graduate school.  In terms of community engagement, the PI of this project gave a talk based on this research titled "Explosions on the Sun" at the Boston Museum of Science "Women and Girls in STEM" event, November 10 &amp; 14, 2018.
