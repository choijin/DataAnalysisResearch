<AbstractNarration>The Historically Black Colleges and Universities - Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) supports conferences that seek to increase the research capacity of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) faculty at HBCUs. The Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment (CREA) at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign will conduct a preconference professional development workshop and subsequent conference sessions at the 2017 CREA conference, which will directly benefit faculty and administrators at HBCUs. CREA 2017 will be held in Chicago, Illinois from September 27-29, 2017.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The professional development activities are designed to support institutional efforts to strengthen competitiveness for research and evaluation in STEM and promote related institutional capacity in broadening participation research. Selected conference participants will gain access to external evaluation expertise, support in implementing culturally and contextually relevant assessment and evaluation practices on their campuses, and be introduced to faculty and consultants interested in collaborating on future research projects. By providing professional development that builds institutional capacity and expertise within the HBCU community of researchers to conduct culturally responsive evaluations and assessments, this projects contributes significantly to the body of knowledge related to broadening participation and ensures evaluations of projects are rigorous, culturally responsive, and contextually relevant.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Project impact began with participant selection. Senior leaders of HBCUs were invited to nominate up to two institutional representatives to attend the preconference workshop and CREA Conference. Nominators were asked to identify institutional representatives based upon how they could influence the quality of future proposal submissions, creating important buy-in and expectations from each participating institution.     Selected faculty and administrators received a customized professional development preconference workshop and attended the 4th International Conference of the Center for Culturally Responsive Evaluation and Assessment (College of Education, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign). The workshop enhanced proposal development skills to improve the competitiveness of proposals submitted to NSF. The highly interactive workshop focused specifically on the incorporation of evaluative thinking and culturally responsive evaluation (CRE) as key elements in conceptualizing projects and proposals.     The workshop curriculum combined content on the Foundations of Culturally Responsive Evaluation (CRE) with mixed methods research and evaluation designs, preparation of logic models, matching project design to institutional context, and basic strategies of program design for evaluability. All content paid special attention to the demands of an HBCU context.  Using the "evaluation cycle" as a metaphor and organizing scheme, presenters guided participants through key strategies for developing and implementing culturally responsive interventions that would meet solicitation requirements of NSF and NIH.      Intellectual merit was enhanced by inclusion of basic logic modeling strategies to provide a nuanced understanding of how and under what circumstances interventions can be expected to work.
