<AbstractNarration>This project will examine the dynamics of the social networks and health of residents in an assisted living facility.  Findings will enhance the understanding of social relationships among residents and the ways in which residents social networks influence their physical and cognitive functioning and depressive symptoms over time.  The research is expected to lead to enhancements in services that encourage social integration, support assisted physical and cognitive functioning, and reduce levels of depressive symptoms among assisted living residents.  In addition, findings may provide evidence for theories of social activity and aging.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;For older adults, social relationships are associated with better physical health, protection from cognitive decline, and reduced depression and anxiety. Residents of assisted living facilities have already experienced declines in their physical or cognitive functioning and have a high prevalence of depression. Although assisted living facilities provide opportunities for socializing and forming new relationships, it is unknown how these opportunities and residents' health affect the formation and maintenance of relationships between residents, nor the extent to which their relationships affect their health.  This research examines the social networks and health of residents of a large assisted living facility in Houston, TX at two points in time six months apart.  The project will (1) describe the structure and change of the residents' social networks; (2) estimate the effects of residents' relationships on health-related outcomes; and (3) estimate the effects of residents' physical limitations, cognitive functioning, and depressive symptoms on their social networks.  Data will be collected in two ways.  First, demographic and other data will be collected from participants resident files.  Second, interviews with residents will be conducted to collect information about the participants social networks and health status.  A comprehensive model of the interconnected social networks within the ALF will be constructed.  Data analysis will be conducted using stochastic actor-oriented models for network dynamics to determine the effects of factors associated with the co-evolution of residents relationships and health over time while controlling for demographic and other related factors (e.g., participation in ALF activities, external relationships).</AbstractNarration>

The acquaintance network was moderately stable over the course of three months (Jaccard index=.382).&nbsp; At the second wave of data collection, there was a tendency for residents with similar levels of physical limitations to be acquainted with one another compared those with greater differences in physical functioning (Moran&rsquo;s <em>i</em>=.013, <em>p</em>&lt;.05).&nbsp;</p> <p>Residents had an average of 2.7 companions at wave 1 and 4.7 at wave 2 (Figure 2).

Nonetheless, on average, residents had negative interactions with about two other residents.&nbsp; The negative interaction network was the least stable of four network types (Jaccard index = .210).&nbsp; At wave 2, negative interactions were more likely to occur between residents with similar levels of depression (Moran&rsquo;s <em>i</em> = .427, <em>p</em> = .003) than between those with greater differences in depressive symptoms.</p> <p>Factors that were significantly associated with the formation of maintenance and creation of social ties across all four networks were (1) the tendency to reciprocate a social tie and (2) the tendency for residents who are more socially active to maintain or add additional social ties compared to those who are less socially active.&nbsp; The study did not find support for the co-evolution of residents&rsquo; social networks and disability-related health nor evidence of social selection or influence in disability-related health over the course of three months.&nbsp; This can likely be explained by the lack of change in disability-related health in the span of three months.&nbsp;</p> <p class="Default">The study has several broader impacts.

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ This project examined the dynamics of four types of social relationships (acquaintances, companionships, social support, and negative interaction) and disability-related health factors (depressive symptoms, physical limitations, and cognitive functioning) among 36 residents of an ALF in Houston, TX.

Participants were predominantly non-Hispanic White (97%), female (67%), widowed (61%) and highly educated (70% had a college degree or higher).  The average age was 82 years old (SD = 8.8 years).  Overall, participants had low levels of depressive symptoms and loneliness.

In contrast, there was a small but statistically significant decrease in their levels of cognitive functioning from an average Mini Mental State Exam score of 27.1 at wave 1 to 25.9 six months later, t(27)=2.428, p=.022.  In general, residents had robust social networks with other residents.  Acquaintances (Figure 1) were the most frequently reported type of relationship, followed by support ties, companionships, and negative interaction ties. There was an average of 11 acquaintances per resident and all residents had at least one acquaintance. The acquaintance network was moderately stable over the course of three months (Jaccard index=.382).  At the second wave of data collection, there was a tendency for residents with similar levels of physical limitations to be acquainted with one another compared those with greater differences in physical functioning (Moran?s i=.013, p&lt;.05).   Residents had an average of 2.7 companions at wave 1 and 4.7 at wave 2 (Figure 2). Some participants (6 at wave 1, 4 at wave 2) had no companionships with other participants. Like the acquaintances, companionships were moderately stable over the course of three months (Jaccard index=.349).  At both waves 1 and 2, residents with similar levels of depressive symptoms were more likely to be companions than those with greater differences in their levels of depressive symptoms (wave 1 Moran?s i=.252, p&lt;.01, wave 2 Moran?s i=.127, p&lt;.05).  Social support was also fairly common among the residents.  On average there were about six to seven other residents with whom a participant had either given or received support.  Support was not more likely to be exchanged between people who were similar in physical limitations, cognitive functioning, or depressive symptoms.  Conversely, support exchanges did not occur between people with larger differences in the disability-related factors (as might be expected if people with greater levels of functioning were helping those with lower levels and potentially greater need).   Negative interactions were the least common of the four types of relationships.  Several residents did not experience negative interactions with the other residents in the network (six at wave 1 and 11 at wave 2). Nonetheless, on average, residents had negative interactions with about two other residents.  The negative interaction network was the least stable of four network types (Jaccard index = .210).  At wave 2, negative interactions were more likely to occur between residents with similar levels of depression (Moran?s i = .427, p = .003) than between those with greater differences in depressive symptoms.  Factors that were significantly associated with the formation of maintenance and creation of social ties across all four networks were (1) the tendency to reciprocate a social tie and (2) the tendency for residents who are more socially active to maintain or add additional social ties compared to those who are less socially active.  The study did not find support for the co-evolution of residents? social networks and disability-related health nor evidence of social selection or influence in disability-related health over the course of three months.  This can likely be explained by the lack of change in disability-related health in the span of three months.  The study has several broader impacts. Findings have been presented nationally at schools of social work and research conferences.  Administrators of the ALF received de-identified reporting to use in planning for resident wellness programming.  The project provided training for a doctoral student in community-based research and social network analysis.  In addition, two research assistants from historically underrepresented groups gained experience in research, academic scholarship, social network analysis, and gerontological theory and practice.  The project also enhanced infrastructure for social network analysis in the field of social work by contributing datasets and training materials.
