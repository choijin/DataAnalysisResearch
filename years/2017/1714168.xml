<AbstractNarration>Results of the recent UNOLS Marine Seismic Questionnaire (MSQ) demonstrate the value of an early&lt;br/&gt;career scientist Multi-Channel Seismic (MCS) chief scientist training cruise. Proposed, and awarded, are funds to carry out &lt;br/&gt; a MCS training program that includes 4 days of seismic data acquisition to increase the number of early career scientists&lt;br/&gt;experienced in marine seismology and to demonstrate the value of the Scripps Institution of&lt;br/&gt;Oceanography portable MCS system, a UNOLS facility. The training program consists of three parts: (i)&lt;br/&gt;Webinars prior to the cruise to expose the participants to the fundamentals of active source marine&lt;br/&gt;seismology, to provide the scientific background needed to plan the upcoming survey effectively, and to&lt;br/&gt;introduce the participants to open source processing and interpretation tools. The Webinars will include&lt;br/&gt;Proposal Writing and Data Management training. Applications will be solicited, including a maximum 2-&lt;br/&gt;page science proposal, after the webinar series. Once selected, participants will discuss their cruise plans&lt;br/&gt;with the PI team prior to the pre-cruise workshop via several telepresence meetings; then, during a 2-day&lt;br/&gt;workshop immediately before the cruise, the participants will finalize the cruise plan under the PI team's&lt;br/&gt;guidance; (ii) A training cruise. Each participant will contribute to the entire team walking off the ship&lt;br/&gt;with post-stack time migrated data, as well as writing a cruise report collaboratively; and (iii) a 2-day data&lt;br/&gt;interpretation workshop with computer-based visualization software.&lt;br/&gt;Intellectual Merit:&lt;br/&gt;The proposed survey regions are on the active continental margin of the west coast of the United States,&lt;br/&gt;where a variety of sedimentary and tectonic settings are available, providing targets of interest to a wide&lt;br/&gt;range of participants. At the extended continental margin off the coast of Oregon, the seismic reflection&lt;br/&gt;profiles acquired, processed, and archived from this cruise can be used to image the subducting plate and&lt;br/&gt;the Astoria Fan, as well as accretionary ridges hosting gas hydrate and pockets of hemipelagic sediment&lt;br/&gt;containing paleo-oceanographic information. Targets have implications for addressing important&lt;br/&gt;societally relevant questions, such as earthquake hazards and paleoclimate records in basins. There will&lt;br/&gt;also be potential for using seismic techniques to reveal real-time, fine-scale within the water column&lt;br/&gt;around upwelling regions of the northeastern Pacific Ocean boundaries. Open access data from this cruise&lt;br/&gt;can augment on-going and near-future science conducted by a broader community.&lt;br/&gt;Broader Impacts:&lt;br/&gt;For this novel, transformative project, early-career scientists will be selected from a wide applicant pool.&lt;br/&gt;This science mission will be advertised on the MSQ and other geoscience listservs, and encouraged participations&lt;br/&gt;of underrepresented minorities and women by promoting the opportunity via organizations such as&lt;br/&gt;Society for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in Scienceand Earth Science&lt;br/&gt;Women's Network. Participants will gain not only first-hand seismic cruise experience but also&lt;br/&gt;experience communicating their research to non-scientists. The proposed activities will be used to inform&lt;br/&gt;the public about the unique and essential contributions of seismic research toward solving a variety of&lt;br/&gt;important societal challenges. Results will be  shared on the AGU's GeoSpace blog and Instagram&lt;br/&gt;account. Important deliverables from the pre-cruise and onboard activities to the community are to&lt;br/&gt;establish and provide "cookbook" of the open source software used during this cruise; and make the data&lt;br/&gt;acquired from the cruise open immediately as soon as they are archived at the publically accessible&lt;br/&gt;archives. A post-cruise survey will be conducted in collaboration with the UNOLS office to obtain&lt;br/&gt;feedback from the participants and encourage the participants to write NSF proposals, the number of&lt;br/&gt;which will be the direct and ultimate measurement of the success of this ECS.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[This project conducted an  academic multichannel seismic (MCS) training program in order to: (1) increase the number of early career scientists experienced in marine seismology; (2) increase the visibility and use cases of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO) portable MCS system; and (3) demonstrate its value as a UNOLS national asset. Our science target was Cascadia continental margin, which is located off the State of Oregon coast and known as the region with seismogenic/tsunamigenic risks to a broader public. The 15-day training program that consists with pre-cruise (3 days webiners, 2 day web cruise-planning conference, 2 days workshop); during-cruise (7 days); and post-cruise (1 day workshop).   Pre-cruise stage: We have convened pre-cruise preparation with prospective participants in April 2017 providing a publicly opened webinar series over three consecutive afternoon hours. This webiners educated nearly 100 registrants every session about a wider variety of topics that enable one to prepare how to propose new science expedition and discovery ideas using UNOLS Academic Fleet, including the SIO portable MCS system. The topics included science related to Cascadia seismogenic continental margin; introduction to US Academic Research Fleet systems; introduction to National Science Foundation proposal submissions process; and introduction to academic multichannel seismics projects. We successfully have selected a total of 19 early career scientists (from MS and PhD student, to postdocs, and to university faculty/assistant professor level; male:female = 10:9). All the participants, grouped into 4 depending on geographical locations of their science objectives,  have then communicated with PIs and they have determined the cruise plan.
