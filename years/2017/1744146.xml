<AbstractNarration>Development of new, more efficient aerodynamic vehicles is a constantly ongoing process. There are many areas of improvement that can be targeted, including reduced drag, enhanced maneuverability, and reduced noise levels. Although there is a long track record of research in aerodynamics, many of the basic properties of fluid flows are not completely understood. For instance, how forces along the surface of a body in motion relate to velocity in the surrounding air. Part of the reason is a lack of proper tools for measuring these flow interactions, which limits the experiments that can be performed. This project looks to develop new tools for the measurement of the flow-generated friction in multiple directions such that they can be combined with existing tools that estimate flow velocity with an ultimate goal of generating comprehensive experimental models of the turbulent motions. Information revealed from these efforts will enhance understanding of fundamental turbulent flows, which can be generalized to other more complex interactions. Furthermore, broad advances in sensor technology can be used by other research groups in their future endeavors, enabling increases in the next generation of aerodynamic performance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A full understanding of the interplay between wall forces and freestream fluid velocity within turbulent flow fields remains elusive and its study requires new technologies. Specifically, the temporal relationship between fluctuating wall shear stress and large scale motion of coherent turbulent structures in a boundary layer, among others. A key limitation to experimental validation of various models is insufficient measurement instrumentation, especially in multi-dimensional flows. Microelectromechanical system (MEMS) based transducers are developed to address this gap, including extending wall shear stress measurement capabilities from single-axis to time-resolved vectors. Specifically, a dual-axis, differential capacitive floating element skin friction sensor possessing a hydraulically smooth package is proposed. The novel sensor will provide the opportunity to sample the velocity field triggered by high-shear events allowing for greater insight into numerous open questions on turbulent boundary layers, including eddy formation, propagation, and the accuracy of the horseshoe vortex model.  It will also provide the ability to make time-resolved vector measurements of wall shear stress at the microscale, which does not currently exist. Development of the novel MEMS sensors will continue to expand on the growing suite of transducers tailored for fluid applications, leading to instrument grade tools for aerodynamicists to utilize elsewhere.</AbstractNarration>

Specifically, this EAGER research effort resulted in a  proof-concept, instrumentation grade, floating-element based differential capacitive shear stress sensor capable of simultaneous mean and time-resolved, two-dimensional, fluctuating shear stress measurements.  The sensors design and associated packaging technology enables a hydraulically smooth, non-invasive measurement of directional skin friction.  The intellectual merits of these activities benefit both the MEMS instrumentation community and the fluids and aerodynamic research community.  This program impacted the following four areas of importance in the MEMS sensor field: multidisciplinary design optimization, innovative fabrication techniques, application-specific packaging, and rigorous device characterization.  It also provides a measurement capability that was currently unavailable to the fluid dynamics community by addressing NSF's Fluid Dynamics program where MEMS shear stress sensors are sought for flow diagnostics.  These sensors can improve our general understanding of fundamental flow physics and also aid further research in fundamental fluid mechanics to facilitate study of the dynamics of complex fluid flows.  From an educational perspective, this effort has broader impacts by contributing to the Ph.D. studies of two students from traditionally underrepresented groups.
