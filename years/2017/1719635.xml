<AbstractNarration>The two-day interdisciplinary Conference on Nonconvex Statistical Learning takes place at the campus of the University of Southern California on Friday, May 26, and Saturday, May 27, 2017. The website of the conference: https://sites.google.com/a/usc.edu/cnsl2017/home will be continuously updated prior to the conference and will provide a repository for the lectures of the meeting to be made available generally.  In today's digital world, huge amounts of data, i.e., big data, can be found in almost every aspect of scientific research and every walk of human activities.  These data need to be managed effectively for reliable prediction, inference, and improved decision making.  Statistical learning is an emergent scientific discipline wherein mathematical modeling, computational algorithms, and statistical analysis are jointly employed to address such a data management problem.  The aim of the conference is to bring together researchers at all levels from multiple disciplines, including computational and applied mathematics, optimization, statistics, and engineering to report on the state of the art of the conference subject and exchange ideas for its further development. Collaborations among the participants will be fostered with the goal of advancing the science of the field of statistical learning and promoting the interfaces of the involved disciplines. The format of the conference consists of roughly two dozen lectures given by expert researchers of the field.  Break times in-between the lectures are scheduled to allow discussions among all participants who will include graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, researchers in academia and industry, and faculty members in universities. This award provides support targeted for the travel expenses of junior participants. &lt;br/&gt; &lt;br/&gt;Till now, convex optimization has been a principal venue for solving many problems in statistical learning.  Yet there is increasing evidence supporting the use of nonconvex formulations to enhance the realism of the models and improve their generalizations.  Superior results and new advances have occurred in areas such as computational statistics, compressed sensing, imaging science, machine learning, bio-informatics and portfolio selection in which nonconvex functionals are employed to express model loss, promote sparsity, and enhance robustness. This conference provides a forum for the participants to report on their research and exchange ideas pertaining to the use of nonconvex functionals in statistical learning.  The topics are organized in four main streams: modeling, advances in computation, big-data statistical learning, and innovative applications.  The lectures will cover both theory and algorithms as well as promising directions for further research.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[  The motivation of this conference stems  from the promising use of nonconvex functionals---most prominently,  surrogates of the renowned discrete function of sparsity count of a  multi-dimensional vector variable---and by the increasing evidence of  their superiority over convex functions in various areas of applications  where big data is prevalent.  The aim of the conference is to bring  together researchers at all levels, from established to junior, and from  cross disciplines that include computational and applied mathematics,  optimization, statistics, and engineering to report on the state of the  art of the conference subject, to exchange ideas for its further  development, and to foster collaborations among the participants with  the goal of advancing the science of the field of statistical learning  and promoting the interfaces of the involved disciplines. The 2-day Conference was held as  planned with great success.  There were 24 lectures each 30 minutes and  more than 70 participants with a good mix of senior and junior  researchers plus graduate students.   The lectures were well received;  there was a lot of discussions among the participants during the breaks. The lectures covered a wide spectrum  of contemporary topics in statistics, optimization, data science,  sparsity representation, deep learning, to name a few.  They spanned  over theory, algorithms, and applications.     The speakers and particpants all  benefitted from the lectures and discussions and learned about the state  of the art of the topics covered by the conference.  New collaborations  were formed among the participants and existing ones strengthened.          Last Modified: 06/02/2018       Submitted by: Jong-Shi Pang]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
