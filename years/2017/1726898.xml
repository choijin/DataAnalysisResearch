<AbstractNarration>The acquisition of an Imaging Time-Of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometer (TOF-SIMS)instrument at the Colorado School of Mines creates an open facility for the analysis of air and moisture sensitive samples that meets the unique needs of academic, industrial, and national laboratory researchers. The advanced chemical analysis afforded by this instrument will directly support areas of national interest in mineral extraction, energy generation and storage, advanced metallurgical alloys, and drug-tissue interactions. For example, the instrument will allow detection of small amounts of segregated impurities in metals that can cause mechanical failures. In mineral extraction, the distribution and chemistry of critical ore deposits can be studied to optimize refining and reduce waste streams. TOF-SIMS can show how atoms incorporate into and degrade battery electrodes, causing shorter lifetimes or failures. This project will (1) build a centrally located, easily accessible capability that meets the unique needs of academic, industrial, and national laboratory researchers, supporting transformative research in areas of national interest; and (2) contribute to advanced technical training and inclusive workforce development, providing training and access to a state-of-the-art instrument.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Acquisition of a state-of-the-art TOF-SIMS instrument suite creates a unique capability in the U.S. for multidisciplinary research in conventional and environmentally sensitive samples and for emerging TOF-SIMS applications. The system configuration includes (1) a transfer vessel for handling air-sensitive samples, (2) an in-situ focused ion beam (FIB) for sectioning samples, and (3) analyzers and ion sources for characterizing both inorganic and organic species. TOF-SIMS enables high spatial resolution (~60 nm) and exceptional chemical sensitivity (down to parts per billion) with 3-D compositional profiling and lateral / depth mapping in virtually all materials. These capabilities open new avenues for understanding the chemistry of materials at nanometer length scales where the performance of materials is often determined.  The University's unique focus on Earth, Energy, and Environment provides opportunities to apply TOF-SIMS to emerging applications, specifically in geosciences, resource recovery, impurities in emerging photovoltaics, transport kinetics in ionic conductors, biological drug delivery, and metallurgical alloy development. The application of SIMS to these problems will broaden the application space for the technique and provide answers to many of the persistent questions in those fields.</AbstractNarration>

The TOF-SIMS instrument has been used for academic and industrial research in areas including solar cells, steels, medical instruments, ceramics, fuel cells, semiconductors, cell tower electronics, quantum computing, automotive, nuclear energy, batteries, and 3D printing. For instance, the instrument was used to make advances in the understanding of corrosion and chemical segregation in modern and historical steels.&nbsp; It was used to map local accumulation of very low concentration species in multiple emerging solar cell technologies to improve their operation and energy conversion efficiencies. Local industries are working with us and using the instrument to enhance their products, manufacturing knowledge, and process control. Though their specific projects and results are proprietary, it is clear that having ready access to this instrument is allowing them to quickly solve problems as they arise as well as allowing them to customize characterization in ways that are unavailable to them by using commercial laboratories. The acquisition of the equipment also enabled the training of many students and post-docs in the characterization of materials by TOF-SIMS, with several of them now entering the technical workforce where they have been sought for these skills.
