<AbstractNarration>Theories of socioecological resilience have attempted to understand how and why systems return to an equilibrium state after a disturbance. More recent research has demonstrated resilience to be more fluid, a dynamic and adaptive response that develops create capacities over time. Using a panarchy model of resilience, which recognizes the ongoing tensions between stability and change, this project seeks to understand how events of varied temporal and spatial and speeds can reciprocally influence produce unpredictable outcomes. The project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations engaged in modeling socio-ecological resilience and mitigating the impacts of environmental change. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Emily Hite, under the supervision of Dr. Jerry Jacka of the University of Colorado at Boulder, will explore the processes by which a diversity of perspectives at multiple scales inform the development and implementation of policy, and the ways in which policy implementation relates to social-ecological resiliency and the production of space and place through time. The research will be conducted in Costa Rica, an ideal site for asking these questions because it is an international leader in renewable energy production and sustainable development, and a policy commitment to becoming one of the world's first carbon neutral countries. This plan relies on completing the Diquís Hydroelectric Project in southwestern Puntarenas Province. However, the Térraba indigenous peoples living in the area have conflicting perspectives regarding the project's potential social, environmental, and economic transformations on their culture, livelihoods, and landscape. The researchers will conduct anthropological research in Térraba and the capital, San José, to better understand the diversity of perspectives of and responses to climate policy, how they are formed, and how they inform policy development. The research team will collect social, ecological, and ethnographic data using participant observation, interviews, household surveys, focus groups, and surveys of plant and animal species used by Térraba peoples. The diversity of qualitative and quantitative data will provide a more comprehensive understanding of how local people are impacted by universal climate policy mechanisms and attempts at the nation-state level to implement those mechanisms.</AbstractNarration>

I also conducted 60 semi-structured interviews and countless informal interviews in San Jos&eacute; and T&eacute;rraba. I interviewed professors and students from the University of Costa Rica and National University of Costa Rica, leaders of indigenous, human rights, and environmentally focused non-government organizations, the Mayor of Buenos Aires Canton, representatives of the Costa Rican Electricity Institute (ICE), governance officials and community members within T&eacute;rraba, and numerous Costa Rican residents.

This research is conducted in Costa Rica because it has the reputation of being an international leader in renewable energy production, sustainable development, and social democracy. It also boasts an ambitious climate policy of becoming one of the world's first carbon neutral countries and offers itself as a laboratory for understanding environmental policy. My research specifically focuses on the historical development of the Diqu&iacute;s Hydroelectric Project in southwestern Puntarenas Province, which is a primary component of fulfilling the country&rsquo;s climate goals. The T&eacute;rraba indigenous peoples have conflicting perspectives regarding the project's potential social, environmental, and economic transformations on their culture, livelihoods, and landscape. After over 40 years of tensions, conflict, and resistance, (and multiple phases of both infrastructural and rhetorical changes), ICE officially cancelled the Diqu&iacute;s project indefinitely in November 2018, citing extenuating financial circumstances. Discontinuation of this project has numerous implications for climate policy in Costa Rica and abroad. This research will contribute to a greater understanding of the diversity of perspectives of and responses to climate policy, how they are formed, and how they inform policy and development. At the conclusion of my research, I will teach a course at Sea Education Association (SEA) during the Fall of 2019 entitled SPICE: Sustainability of Polynesian Island Cultures and Ecosystems. I was offered this position because of the similarities between my current work and the new direction that SEA is taking in regards to incorporating anthropology into their marine conservation agenda. I will analyze data and write my dissertation during this time and continue with analysis, write up, and publications when I return to the University of Colorado Boulder in the Spring of 2020. Working with SEA will also allow me to further explore the themes of climate policy, space and place, and indigenous resistance/resilience in relation to Costa Rica. I will present results of my dissertation research at the American Anthropological Association meeting in November 2019 and at the Society for Applied Anthropology in March 2020. I expect to publish in a variety of academic and non-academic outlets on my research based on interests I have already received.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 03/02/2019<br>      Modified by: Emily&nbsp;B&nbsp;Hite</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
