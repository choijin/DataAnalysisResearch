<AbstractNarration>The proposed research will investigate a new approach to design of non-linear signal processing systems, utilizing efficient real time implementation of frequency weighted least square optimization with signal value constraints: a modified classical Wiener filter setup, in which the optimized signal has to minimize&lt;br/&gt;a quadratic frequency domain integral, subject to its samples being restricted to a given compact set. In particular, such optimization is motivated by applications in peak-to-power ratio reduction, where the optimized output signal has to be as close as possible to the input, while satisfying a spectral mask constraint, as well as an absolute value bound imposed on its time domain samples. Another motivating application is optimal quantization, where the output signal has to provide the best approximation of the input, as quantified by a frequency-weighted integral error measure, while its time domain samples are restricted to a finite set. In addition, the proposed research aims to establish an analytical foundation for complexity reduction of high quality linear finite impulse response filters, a ubiquitous element of digital signal processing units, prone to consume significant resources in FPGA and ASIC implementations. Defining the ideal response of a signal processing system as the solution of an optimization task specified in terms of system input is a well-established fundamental idea in filter design. A well-known example is the case of unconstrained frequency weighted quadratic optimization, where the optimal solution is a linear function of the input, implemented by the Wiener filter. In the case of constrained frequency weighted quadratic optimization, to be investigated in this proposal, analytical conditions of optimality are well known, but come in the discouraging form of an infinite set of non-linear equations with respect to an infinite number of variables. The proposed research is based on the recent observation supporting the expectation that, under reasonable assumptions, the dynamic mapping from the input to the optimal output will have exponentially fading memory, and, moreover, will be approximated extremely accurately by a specific class of feedback-based real time algorithms. The proposal intends to build a non-causal version of robustness analysis machinery, to quantify and assess exponential stability of nonlinear dynamical systems in which the current output sample depends in equal degree on the past and future inputs, and to provide high quality real time realizations of such systems.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The proposed work has the potential to deliver a fundamentally new class of practical non-linear signal processing algorithms with superior performance. It will also enhance the theory of robustness analysis of feedback control by extending some of its basic tools to non-causal systems motivated by signal processing applications. The application problems in this proposal are motivated by the current needs of developing digital signal processing algorithms for the next generation of communication devices, most significantly, those involved in digital signal conditioning in radios (cell tower base stations, WiFi hubs, etc.) If successful, the proposed research will become a factor in reducing power consumption and footprint of common digital signal processing units. It may also affect the way communication standards are written, by ensuring easy access to efficient high performance implementation of a number of common signal processing tasks. Thus, the project may contribute to increased partnerships between academia and industry, and increase economic competitiveness of the US.</AbstractNarration>
