<AbstractNarration>Non-technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The quantum mechanical phenomena of Bose Einstein Condensation leads to many fascinating and important effects.  In 4He it leads to a superfluid where the liquid can flow with viscosity and transport heat without loss.  In some metals it leads to superconductivity where electric currents are carried without loss - offering the potential for power distribution without the losses that occur in current power lines.  BEC has also been observed in super-cooled atoms which could lead to more precise atomic clocks that power the global positioning system.   Other, yet to be discovered systems, may show equally fascinating and important behavior.  In this project we will attempt to produce a Bose Einstein Condensate in hydrogen atoms embedded in solid molecular hydrogen. The studies will take place at ultra-low temperature (below 0.1 degrees above absolute zero) and utilize microwave magnetic resonance techniques.  This work will provide training in state-of-the-art low temperature and microwave techniques which are relevant in many areas of physics such as quantum computing.  An active outreach program is pursued. Meetings with graduate students, visits by junior college students and participation in science fairs continues. For example, the principal investigator gives public lectures at the Texas A &amp; M Physics and Engineering Festival with demonstrations. The festival is typically attended by more than 5000 students from all over the state of Texas and beyond.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Technical Abstract&lt;br/&gt;The properties of hydrogen atoms embedded in solid molecular hydrogen films are studied by electron spin resonance in a high magnetic field (4.6 Tesla, resonant frequency 130 GHz) corresponding to 2mm waves. The spectrometer for these measurements is fully operational. A dilution refrigerator is now in place to cool the samples to temperatures below 100 mK. The large departure of the polarization of the nuclear spins from the Boltzmann distribution observed previously are investigated down to lower temperatures and at higher hydrogen atom concentrations in an attempt to reach full Bose-Einstein condensation. Although in previous experiments the spin-lattice relaxation was found to be several hours, it was not possible to fully saturate the transition between the two lowest hyperfine states. This anomalous behavior is fully investigated. Hole burning experiments in a magnetic field gradient also are performed to determine the hydrogen atom mobility as Bose-Einstein condensation occurs. Finally, the effect of different film substrates on the departure from Boltzmann statistics of hydrogen atoms are studied.</AbstractNarration>

According to quantum theory, the particles will act as waves, and as temperature is lowered, these wavelengths increase so particles tend to overlap with one another, thereby making it possible for collections of particles to form new configurations. For example, systems of light hydrogen atoms embedded in solid molecular films are very promising for observation of new quantum phenomena at low temperatures.  In this research program, magnetic properties of hydrogen (H) atoms embedded in films of solid molecular hydrogen (H2) were studied. High densities of H atoms in solid H2 of order 0.1% were achieved when the samples were cooled down to the temperature region between 0.1 and 1 Kelvin by standard cryogenic techniques. The magnetic behavior of the H atoms embedded in the H2 films was investigated via high frequency (128 GHz) magnetic resonance allowing measurements of the nuclear magnetic polarization of hydrogen atoms.

The rate of penetration of the highly concentrated region into the sample was carefully monitored by a series of magnetic resonance measurements. From these studies, it was possible to estimate the rate of spatial diffusion of H atoms into the solid H2 film. The rate was found to be two orders of magnitude faster than the rate found earlier from studies of recombination of H atoms.  The third important result involves the observation of the melting of the ensembles of tiny clusters of solid H2 and solid D2 at temperatures below 1 Kelvin degree above absolute zero, whereas the normal melting temperatures for the corresponding bulk solids were much higher. The nuclear-polarized phases discovered are highly interesting for researchers working in the fields of solid-state magnetism, polarized targets for neutron scattering experiments, and also provide first evidence for the formation of triplet H2 molecules where the electron spins are aligned parallel to one another. The existence of this triplet molecular state in laboratory conditions is of fundamental value in view of the importance of hydrogen atoms and molecules as model systems for calculations in quantum physics and chemistry.  Melting of H2 clusters at temperatures 0.1-0.6 K observed in this project provides a strong and highly promising foundation for studies of even smaller para-H2 clusters which may become superfluid. The observation of superfluidity in the ensembles of para-H2 clusters will be another important outcome of this work, which is extremely interesting for a broad community of researchers well beyond the quantum liquids and solids field.
