<AbstractNarration>This project funds continued operations and science investigations associated with the Low-Latitude Ionospheric Sensor Network (LISN). LISN is a distributed array of GPS receivers, magnetometers and ionosondes, that measure  ionospheric parameters in the low-latitude South American sector. The network is on the same continent and within the latitude belt of the Jicamarca observatory, that hosts a suite of thermosphere-ionosphere observing systems. The overarching science goal enabled by the LISN observatory is to understand the complex day-to-day variability and the extreme disturbances that occur in the South American low-latitude ionosphere nearly every day after sunset. These occurrences pose a prominent natural hazard to communication, navigation and high precision pointing systems. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The projects outlined in this proposal will help to understand the onset of plasma structuring that takes place at low and mid latitudes and that affect communication and navigation systems. LISN real-time data are available to space weather forecasting enterprises that elect to avail themselves of it. LISN is an international collaboration that nurtures new technological expertise and graduate-level aeronomy courses in South American countries.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The goal of this project was to operate a distributed observatory in South America that is dedicated to investigating the upper layers of the atmosphere (say between 100 and 600 km altitude).  This region is called the ionosphere due to the presence of free electrons and ions. A distributed observatory consists of a large number, more than 20, of small instruments installed in different cities and extending across a continent or a large region of the Earth. Instruments that were used included GPS receivers, magnetic field detectors, and small radars that can be easily deployed in small spaces.  Data collected by these distributed instruments were used to assess the day-to-day variability of the ionosphere, and follow the formation of medium and large-scale structures.  We found that these structures typically develop electric fields that map to other regions and a mirror image can be seen at other latitudes.  The project included a Web site designed to collect, store, and disseminate all the measurements to members of the scientific community and to the general public as well.  These investigations are useful for the improvement of communications and to design new methods to predict the behavior of the ionosphere.  This will help aero civil navigation.
