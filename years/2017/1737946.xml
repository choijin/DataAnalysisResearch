<AbstractNarration>The nation faces a shortage of skilled technical professionals in occupations that require a high level of knowledge and skills in advanced technical fields, but may not require baccalaureate degrees. According to the National Research Council, the mathematical sciences are part of most every aspect of everyday life; and even in old-line industries, the role of the mathematical sciences has expanded. While specific mathematical competencies vary with the demands of different occupations and professions, the need for such competencies in the skilled technical workforce is without question. This conference will explore what mathematics is needed and the steps the STEM education enterprise should take to ensure students can successfully develop the requisite mathematical competency and fluency.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;With regards to intellectual merit, the "Needed Math: Advanced Technological Education Conference" will bring together three groups of thought-leaders to establish and propose a set of common mathematics concepts and skills that are pre-requisites for education and employment of technicians in STEM-related careers in biotechnology, information/communication technology, and advanced manufacturing.  Conference attendees will represent three communities that have a stake in needed mathematics:  math educators and researchers; community college faculty; and STEM employers.   The charge to attendees of  the conference  is to (1) characterize specific mathematics skills that employers in those domains look for; (2) identify the unifying math concepts that underlie those skills; (3) propose needed action to take to teach those concepts effectively to students in grades 7-14; (4) synthesize recommendations and results in an edited set of Conference proceedings; and (5) disseminate conference deliverables to a wide audience in a variety of veues and in a variety of formats.  In terms of broader impacts, the conference intends to provide guidance to groups of stakeholders with regards to the teaching and learning of mathematics in support of developing and sustaining a diverse workforce of skilled technical professionals.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Overview  Employers, instructors of technical subjects, and mathematics educators participated in a three-day conference on January 12-15, 2018. They concluded that students? mathematical competence should be strengthened by enhancing their ability to solve problems found in real-world contexts. The Needed Math Conference, supported by the Advanced Technological Education (ATE) program of the National Science Foundation (Grant number: 1737946), focused on bringing to light how mathematics education might better reflect the concepts and skills that are prerequisites for postsecondary education technical programs and for successful employment as skilled technicians in STEM-related fields, as well as in many other occupations. Adding contextual relevance can demonstrate the utility and beauty of the mathematics students learn. Students who have this experience of studying mathematics in real-world contexts will have a firmer basis on which to build more advanced concepts.     Intellectual Merit  Many high school graduates find it difficult to pass the math exams required for acceptance into STEM technician programs in community colleges. Even those who do gain acceptance often have to take additional math courses in order to stay enrolled. Moreover, given the difficulty encountered by STEM employers in recruiting qualified employees, the concern was raised that the math competencies measured by high stakes assessments may not be aligned to the needs of the workplace. The aims of this Conference were to (1) facilitate conversations among employers, instructors, and math educators and researchers leading to an identification of the math competencies skilled technicians need to be successful in the workplace and (2) motivate math educators and researchers to investigate how teaching needed math can broadly increase mathematical understanding.  The Project Steering Committee of STEM educators, researchers, and employers were individuals who have exceptional experience in working with grades 7-14 students and teachers. The invited Conference participants were well placed to help bridge the gap between the math skills taught and assessed (skills which also erect a formidable barrier to further education, especially for underrepresented minority students) and the skills that are actually required to be gainfully employed in the 21st century technological economy.     Broader Impacts   The Conference intended to provide guidance to the STEM technician education community relative to the math competencies technicians in several STEM/ATE domains (biotechnology, information technology, and manufacturing technology) need to be successful in the workplace. The Conference model is transferable to other domains.  A nationwide community of employers, STEM technician educators, and math educators and researchers participated. The Steering Committee was committed to inviting a balance of female and male participants who represent geographic, ethnic, and racial diversity. Sincere efforts were made to include people with disabilities, and the Conference venue was fully accessible.  In addition to identifying math skills and practices needed by technicians in the STEM workplace, the Conference stimulated math educators, industrialists, instructors, and researchers to consider how best to further students? mathematical understanding beyond the math needed for employment, that is in traditional areas of mathematics.
