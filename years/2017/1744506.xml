<AbstractNarration>The University of Maine will address the grand challenge of increasing Native American participation in the science,technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) enterprise in an NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot project addressing culturally relevant pedagogy, incorporating Community Elders, Cultural Knowledge Keepers, and mainstream secondary and higher education institutions in the development of STEM pedagogy that can be replicated to other underrepresented and underserved populations. Partners in the effort include the Wabanaki Youth in Science program (WaYS)(a non-profit organization), Salish Kootenai College (a Tribal College), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (a research university), the National Indian Education Association (a non-profit membership organization) and the current NSF INCLUDES Design and Development Launch Pilot project at the University of Maine (the Stormwater Research Management Team (SMART)). This NSF INCLUDES partnership provides students with evidence-based STEM activities involving culturally relevant internships, mentoring, STEM professional development activities and other support. Non-native students will reciprocally participate in Native American learning environments.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The foundation for the project's activities is based on the WaYS program in science education that incorporates Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK). The goals of the project are to: 1) create and integrate curriculum that embraces TEK and western science as equal partners; 2)develop and implement protocols to incorporate a continued mentorship program for WaYS and STREAM engineering students; 3)develop a framework to bridge the gap between high school and college; and 4) foster collaboration among Community Elders, Cultural Knowledge Keepers and University of Maine faculty in a model that could be transferred to other communities. Internal and external evaluation activities will add to the scholarly literature on educating Native Americans and non-native students in STEM disciplines. Dissemination of project results will include published peer-reviewed journal articles on newly developed pedagogy and conference presentations at the American Indian Science and Engineering (AISES) national conference, the National Diversity in STEM Conference, National Science Teachers Association, AAAS, ASEE and the National NSF INCLUDES Network.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ NSF INCLUDES DDLP: Wabanaki Youth in Science (WaYS) Program to Bridge inclusion in Post-Secondary Education Through the Sciences created partnerships and research to advance the inclusion of Cultural Science (CS) in STEM education at the university level.  One of the biggest impacts of the research are the qualitative and quantitative results that indicate that the successful addition of Cultural Science (CS) should be part of STEM academic models for both Native and non-Native students. This builds on our prior work with Native American middle and high school students in the Wabanaki Youth in Science (WaYS) program, which proved that the inclusion of CS enhances learning for Native  students in secondary education.  Our groundbreaking research provides the data needed to prove what many, especially in the Native community, already intuitively knew.  It provides a foundational springboard to create dialog to create change within predominantly white academic institutions (PWIs). This work begins the process to dispel deficit thinking that predominates a significant amount of cultural and racial minority oriented STEM education by providing an alternative pedagogical method to teaching.  Our research will provide the greatest impact on STEM teaching, not only at the post-secondary level, but it can be translated to middle and high school curriculum, if desired. Understanding the inherent and necessary knowledge that CS brings into post-secondary education is paramount.  The fact that our model incorporates Tribal community-based cultural knowledge keepers (CKKs) provides an additional benefit and broadening of intellectual knowledge by incorporating CS into post-secondary STEM curriculum.   Over the last 15 years, a number of scholars have provided frameworks to educational institutions and the US government to acknowledge and support the important role of CS. It is not only possible but necessary that we incorporate CS into STEM fields to not only enhance student learning but to increase faculty knowledge and pedagogical practice, thereby providing an avenue for heightened learning for all students.  In developing our protocols and best practices in our INCLUDES grant, we recognized that merely offering a new opportunity to enhance the learning of Native students was not enough to impact the teaching of STEM across the university.  We recognized that academic departments were the key controls of pedagogical practices wherein roles, routines, symbols (what is considered real or important), and practices shape the culture of teaching at the departmental level. We believe that each of these elements of practice must be considered in order to make a sustainable impact and create institutional change.  In that regard, we recognize that merely making CKKs available to faculty to include in their classes is not enough to impact departmental practice and create institutional change.  Thus, the research provides us with an opportunity to create needed change within PWIs. Understanding complexity in systems requires exploring the issue thoroughly enough to understand the true nature of the problem and identifying underlying assumptions that are limiting current thinking.  The positive results from this project and research provides an initial mechanism to start turning around the dominant pedagogy in post secondary STEM education.  The two-year study was just the beginning but it was a strong start to initiate change.           Last Modified: 01/03/2021       Submitted by: Darren Ranco]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
