<AbstractNarration>With funding from the National Science Foundation's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (S-STEM) program, the Transfer Student Research and Integration Program (TRIP) is providing support to low-income students with demonstrated financial need and academic promise to success in STEM disciplines at the University of Central Florida.  The project is funding 72 scholars over five years who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in Biology and Biotechnology.  Fields within STEM are critical to our nation's infrastructure and economy. Â Unfortunately, high rates of attrition from STEM programs have produced a shortfall of STEM-educated workers. A fast and cost-effective way to alleviate this issue is to reduce attrition rates in existing student populations. Transfer students (i.e., those who obtain an Associate's degree prior to matriculating into a 4-year institution), a large and growing segment of the student population, exhibit unusually high rates of attrition. Research suggests that attrition for these students often results from a lack of (i) undergraduate research experiences, (ii) integration into vital communities that facilitate peer networks, (iii) professional development, and (iv) financial solvency. Although many students suffer from these deficits, transfer students are particularly susceptible due to their entrance into a 4-year institution late into their academic studies and a greater than average need to work while pursuing a Bachelor's degree. To minimize these issues, TRIP scholars will enter a 2-year program that engages them in team-oriented original research, integrates them into academic and scientific communities, and facilitates their professional development. All the while, TRIP scholars will receive a scholarship that allows them to more fully pursue their research and educational activities by minimizing their need to work. TRIP's short-term mission is to increase the retention of these students in STEM majors while providing the hard and soft skills necessary for success. TRIP's long-term goal is to increase the representation of this diverse group within the scientific workforce, including positions in local, state and federal government; academic institutions; non-government organizations; and private industry. Importantly, TRIP represents a model that can be adopted by other STEM programs (such as Chemistry, Physics and Mathematics) as well as other institutions, especially those that are beacons for talented students lacking financial independence and that are burdened with a high student to faculty ratio. It is our goal to create a sustainable model grounded in the Science of Teaching and Learning that can address a litany of institutional barriers that deprives academically talented students access to a career in science.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The global objective of TRIP is to increase the number of Biology and Biotechnology graduates who enter the University of Central Florida as transfer students. To this end, 18 transfer students per year will be selected for TRIP, based on financial need and academic potential. At its core, TRIP addresses the pressing need for students to acquire original research experience while pursuing a STEM degree. Unfortunately, most students traverse their undergraduate careers without engaging in the process of science due to the scarcity of available faculty mentors. TRIP alleviates the mentor shortage by engaging cohorts of students in an Introduction to Research course, followed by a Group Effort Applied Research (GEAR) 4-credit laboratory. The GEAR curriculum provides concept-driven lectures coupled with authentic, team-oriented research embedded within the research program of the faculty instructor. After GEAR, students enroll in an Independent Study course where they transform their efforts into a scientific poster and/or manuscript. While enrolled in their three research courses, students will interact through numerous community integration and professional development activities, including social events, team building exercises, and career workshops. These activities strengthen peer networks and provide additional skills needed for success. After the courses are complete, TRIP scholars will integrate into the larger scientific community by presenting their work at two scientific conferences.</AbstractNarration>
