<AbstractNarration>This project aims to develop a deeper understanding of the factors influencing Native American or Alaskan Native (hereafter referred to as Native American) participation in the engineering professorate. According to a 2014 NACME report, only 0.4% of engineers are Native American, and even fewer engineering faculty are Native American. Engineering faculty are important in attracting and retaining students by providing positive socio-cultural experiences, role modeling, mentorship, and inclusive learning environments that reduce isolation. However, little is known about the factors promoting Native Americans' entry into the engineering professorate or persistence as engineering faculty members. The project's research will provide systematic evidence that could lead to best practices in providing Native Americans with experiences and support to encourage them to pursue the engineering professorate and consider the academy as their professional home. In an era of decreased enrollment in engineering programs, enhancing diversity is key to long term growth and global competitiveness. Diversity in engineering fields is more than an issue of fairness and equity, but also of quality of the engineering endeavor. Cultivating the talent and promoting full inclusion of Native Americans in the engineering professorate can promote diversity in the workforce to encourage the growth, creativity, and innovation necessary to solving our most pressing tribal, national, and global problems.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There is a critical need to investigate potential factors and the linkages among them to make meaningful progress toward increasing the number of Native American faculty in engineering. However, the lack of prior systematic investigations means that research methods and materials designed to tap underlying constructs are unavailable, and that pilot data on which to base more extended investigations are non-existent. Therefore, the overall objective of this proposal is two-fold: 1) to conduct an exploratory pilot study of hypothesized factors and the linkages among them in several samples of Native American engineering students and faculty, including participants from Oklahoma, Minnesota, and members of the American Indian and Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and 2) to develop methods and materials in preparation for subsequent cross-sectional and longitudinal work. The central hypothesis is that there are identifiable factors that explain Native Americans' entry into and persistence in the engineering professorate, and that these factors are discoverable and accessible through quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods means. The project aims to recruit Native American engineering undergraduates, graduate students, and faculty to capture current and retrospective perceptions of their journey toward and participation in the engineering professorate. The team will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data, and disseminate findings in ways that advance foundational knowledge of the field. In so doing, this effort will lay the groundwork for subsequent studies on broadening participation of Native Americans in the engineering faculty.</AbstractNarration>

This research explored the supports and barriers to Native Americans? interest in, entry into, and persistence as engineering students and faculty. Although Native Americans comprise 2.1% of the U.S. population, they represent only 0.6% (<em>N</em> = 1853) of the total number of engineering students, and only 0.2% (<em>N</em> = 68) of the total number of engineering faculty (Yoder, 2016; NACME, 2012; World Population Review, 2020). The objectives of this project were (1) to conduct an exploratory pilot study with several samples of Native American engineering students and faculty, including participants from Oklahoma, Minnesota, and members of the American Indian and Science and Engineering Society (AISES), and (2) to develop methods and materials in preparation for subsequent cross-sectional and longitudinal work.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Intellectual Merit</span></strong></p> <p>To conduct this research, we used both quantitative research methods (e.g., anonymous surveys) and qualitative research methods (e.g., virtual interviews, in-person interviews, and focus groups). Our methods were designed in collaboration with Native American educators, scientists, social scientists, advisors, students and faculty. We consulted with Native American community members concerning the appropriateness of recruitment methods, questions and interpretations of results. Our research questions, research design and data analysis were founded on Social Cognitive Career Theory (Lent et al., 1994, 2000), and Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory (1977).&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts (Pilot Study)</span></strong></p> <p>We used multiple methods that were respectful of community mores and preferences, and that were designed to amplify the voices of the Native American community concerning those supports and barriers that either hampered or promoted Native American participation in engineering and the engineering faculty. We presented findings in professional venues in order to inform other scientists and social scientists of the outcome of this study and to enhance its intellectual merit. We presented findings to students, educators and interested Native American community members to enhance application to new and ongoing initiatives. We trained the next generation of scientists in working closely with graduate and undergraduate students in best practices in conducting research with Native American communities. By employing these methods, we sought to support the aspirations of Native Americans to prepare for and pursue their career dreams and goals for becoming engineers and engineering educators.&nbsp;</p> <p><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Major findings of this study for both faculty and students</span></strong></p> <ol> <li>The interest in, entry into, and persistence as <strong>engineering faculty</strong> were supported by self-efficacy, which was qualitatively related to early experiences with teaching others and/or presenting research. Entry as faculty engineering was described as happenstance and based on unintentional factors related to geography or research track. Faculty microsystems seemed most influential in these cases, due to family needs or mentorship. Group support from professional societies and satisfaction from student successes was an important component of persistence. Faculty valued the opportunity to mentor students, but also voiced hesitance to directly encourage students to enter the faculty given the high entry level pay for engineering industry professionals.</li> <li>Entry      into and persistence in their engineering educational programs were      supported by parents? encouragement, and by a campus climate that was      cooperative, friendly, equitable, and respectful. The biggest challenges these students      have are financial      (e.g. not enough money to get through school, working during school) and      academic (e.g., not sufficiently prepared in high school). Additionally,      feelings of not fitting in and a lack of career information were      identified as barriers to persistence. Approximately 35% of the      engineering students expressed an interest in becoming engineering faculty      as one of their career options. Those who did have that aspiration also      expressed greater efficacy for studying engineering (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = .45, <em>p</em> &lt;      .05, greater efficacy for becoming an engineering faculty (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = .63, <em>p</em> &lt; .01),      and greater parent, peer and community support for becoming an engineering      faculty (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = .58, <em>p</em> &lt; .05), and a stronger belief that      studying engineering would be important to their future (<em>r</em><sup>2</sup> = .42, <em>p</em> &lt;      .05).</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Broader Impacts (Methods and Materials)</span></strong></p> <p>We found that designing methods and materials in collaboration with the Native American community and through collaborating with AISES and other Native American scholars, educators, psychologists, and community leaders, we were able to successfully meet our broader impact goals of: 1) advancing the full participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM; 2) develop a deeper understanding of the role of barriers and supports in regards to opting into a faculty role in engineering; and 3) disseminate rigorous and culturally-informed findings to the scientific and academic communities via publications and presentations, and increased the intellectual merit of future studies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 12/29/2020<br>      Modified by: Sue&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jacobs</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609297543718_eager1(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609297543718_eager1(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="STEM Students doing Hands-On Activities"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609297543718_eager1(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="STEM Students doing Hands-On Activities"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">STEM students attending AISES Region 4 meeting March 2018 in Stillwater, OK at Oklahoma State University engaged in hands on activities with EAGER Team</div> <div class="imageCredit">Sue C Jacobs</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sue&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jacobs</div> <div class="imageTitle">STEM Students doing Hands-On Activities</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296285354_EAGERSTUDENTS--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296285354_EAGERSTUDENTS--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EAGER students Outcome/recruitment flyer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296285354_EAGERSTUDENTS--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EAGER students Outcome/recruitment flyer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This flyer was used at the 2018 national AISES conference in Oklahoma City and elsewhere to share some findings and recruit more participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Colston and OSU team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sue&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jacobs</div> <div class="imageTitle">EAGER students Outcome/recruitment flyer</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296888570_EAGERFACULTY--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296888570_EAGERFACULTY--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Eager Faculty Outcome/Recruitment"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296888570_EAGERFACULTY--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Eager Faculty Outcome/Recruitment"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This flyer was used at the October 4-6, 2018 national AISES conference in Oklahoma City and elsewhere to share some findings and recruit more participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Colston and OSU Team</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sue&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jacobs</div> <div class="imageTitle">Eager Faculty Outcome/Recruitment</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296002319_RecruitmentflyerEAGER(1)--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296002319_RecruitmentflyerEAGER(1)--rgov-800width.jpg" title="EAGER recruitment flyer"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2020/1743572/1743572_10520705_1609296002319_RecruitmentflyerEAGER(1)--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="EAGER recruitment flyer"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">This flyer was used by both OSU and UMN and through AISES to recruit participants</div> <div class="imageCredit">Nicole Colston and OSU team</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Public Domain</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Sue&nbsp;C&nbsp;Jacobs</div> <div class="imageTitle">EAGER recruitment flyer</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
