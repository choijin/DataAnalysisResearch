<AbstractNarration>In a cyber-physical system, the operation of the physical plant is typically maintained by closed-loop control, which is intended to keep the plant process variables in a desired range. A major part of any control system is its instrumentation, i.e., sensors and actuators. Due to information exchange between the controller and the instrumentation, the control system performance may be compromised by attacks on its sensors and actuators. Indeed, the sensors may project erroneous information to the controller and the actuators may receive undesirable commands, possibly leading to a catastrophe. In this research, the control system is referred to as resilient, if it identifies attacks on the sensors and actuators involved in the feedback loops and mitigates undesirable effects. The goal of the proposed research is to develop a theory for analysis and design of resilient control systems with respect to attacks on the instrumentation and to demonstrate its efficacy using the High Performance Building Testbed at the United Technologies Research Center. The broader impact of the project is in its effect on cyber-security of critical infrastructure systems, such as power, telecommunications, transportation, high performance buildings, gas, oil, and water.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    In this project, we consider control systems, in which the sensors and actuators may be under various types of instrumentation attacks through transfer function modification and/or external deception signal injection. This project include developing the following techniques: A method for system vulnerability evaluation with respect to various instrumentation attacks; a method for optimal controller design to minimize performance degradation under attacks, while meeting desired performance specifications under non-attacked condition; a method for actuator/sensor health assessment in control systems using the synchronous detection approach; a method for design of resilient feedback controllers, driven by the actuator and sensor health to detect, identify, and mitigate instrumentation attacks; a method for knowledge fusion for process variable estimation based on multiple sensors and control signal calculation based on the knowledge fusion results. The project will significantly enhance the field of CPS from the point of view of resiliency. &lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

The goal of the proposed research is to develop a theory for analysis and design of resilient control systems with respect to attacks on the instrumentation  This project focuses three theoretical problems:  Problem 1: Vulnerability analysis: Develop analytical metrics for quantitative evaluation of the system vulnerability with respect to instrumentation attacks on the sensor and/or the actuator for LTI systems and extend the results to nonlinear (quasi-linear) systems. Problem 2: Controller design optimization: Develop rigorous methods forselectingcontroller structure and parameters for LTI systems, which minimize the performancedegradation caused by a given set of instrumentation attacks, while satisfying desired nominal system performance.  Problem 3: Resilient control: Develop methods for design and analysis of resilient control systems, which degrade gracefully under attacks on their sensors and actuators. Here, the term "degrade gracefully" is understood as identifying the attacked sensors and actuators and mitigating their undesirable effects on meeting the performance specifications. This research is introducing a new paradigm in the area of CPS: instrumentation attack-resilient control systems. This includes methods for system vulnerability analysis, controller optimization, synchronous detection-based sensor/actuator health assessment, resilient controller design for attack identification and mitigation, and knowledge fusion for resilient controlling MIMO systems.
