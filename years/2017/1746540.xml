<AbstractNarration>This SBIR phase I project will develop new reagents to enable cell separation and analysis. Cell separation is a $3.9 billion/yr market with applications in medicine, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, many current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. The nanoparticle reagent developed by this research possesses magnetic properties to enable cell separation, and fluorescent properties that allow properties of separated cells to be quantified. This research will optimize this product and demonstrate proof-of-concept against the current standard approaches. The proposed product is the result of basic research previously funded by the NSF into methods to combine magnetic and fluorescent reagents, and optimization of this reagent will yield basic knowledge in manufacture and scale-up of these nanomaterials. Successful completion of these goals will lead to a new product that will enable cell separation and analysis with a single reagent, enabling cell separation with high purity and increasing signal used for quantification. These benefits could translate into reduced laboratory healthcare costs with increased diagnostic efficiency, improved pharmaceutical purity, and high tech nanomanufacturing jobs in this burgeoning industry.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This research will develop magnetic-fluorescent nanoparticle reagents to enable seamless cell separation and subsequent flow cytometry analysis. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; however, analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads for separation prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the protein quantified. Even if small nanoparticles are used, a separate reagent is required for analysis, and signal is limited as the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Thus, a reagent that could perform both separation and analysis steps would improve performance. This research will optimize nanoparticle reagents that enable separation and analysis and compare their performance to the current approach using two separate reagents. Thus, this research will demonstrate crucial proof-of-concept of these reagents that are manufactured using a scalable process, enabling rapid transition to beta testing and follow-on commercialization.&lt;br/&gt;</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>This SBIR phase I project developed MagDots, nanoparticles composed of fluorescent semiconductor quantum dots and superparamagnetic nanoparticles, for cell separation and characterization.</p> <p>Cell separation is a $3.9 billion/yr market with applications in medical, pharmaceutical, and biological research industries. However, most current schemes perform cell separation and analysis in separate steps. Cell separation is often performed with magnetic reagents that enable high throughput; yet analysis of the separated product is performed in a separate step, typically via flow cytometry. The use of large magnetic beads (versus smaller beads) allows for a fast bulk separation because of their high magnetic content, but prevents analysis, as the beads employed are much larger than the surface antigens to be subsequently analyzed, blocking their fluorescent labeling with dye molecules. Therefore, larger magnetic particles are often removed prior to cell analysis, which can degrade antigen conformation and takes skill and time. When small, commercially available nanoparticles are used for magnetic separation, the particles do not need to be removed prior to fluorescent labeling, but often the same receptors are targeted for both separation and analysis steps. Also, cells with fewer antigens are harder to isolate because of the reduced magnetic content of small particles. A single reagent that could perform both functions would save time and money, enhancing these industries. MagDots, the nanoparticle reagent developed by this research, possess magnetic properties that enable cell separation and fluorescent properties that allow antigens of separated cells to be characterized.</p> <p>This research optimized MagDot size and the magnetic nanoparticle loading (Figure 1) to achieve similar or improved magnetic mobility imparted on labeled cells compared to commercial magnetic beads. The fluorescent quantum dot component was optimized to enable fluorescent analysis via flow cytometry comparable to conventional organic fluorescent dyes (Figure 2). Then, MagDot cell separation performance was tested in a commercial magnetic separator in a head to head comparison against commercial nanoparticles sold with the separator. Results (recovery and purity) were verified by flow cytometry for MagDots and compared to those for commercial particles. MagDots and commercial particles had nearly 100% recovery of target cells with purity &gt; 75%. However, there was a three-fold to an order of magnitude improvement in recovery of unintended cells (lower nonspecific binding) using MagDots. These properties make MagDots ideal candidates for purification of heterogeneous samples with subsequent fluorescence confirmation of antigen targeting in a single step. Customer interviews performed during this Phase I project confirmed that many users of flow cytometry would like to be able to separate more complex samples, such as those from bio-banks, faster with integrated confirmation of a targeted marker. Biobanks provide a collection of human biological specimens and their associated data to researchers, yet very few biobanks offer their users access to purified cell samples, primarily because of a lack of high throughput cell purification technologies. MagDot- based cell separation could be integrated into routine sample processing procedures to yield pure cell samples. This would save researchers from laborious and time-consuming sample preparation procedures, enabling faster collection of clinical data while ensuring integrity of cells promulgating the disease.</p> <p>The MagDot is the second product licensed from The Ohio State University Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering with Dr. Jessica Winter as the lead inventor. MagDot development in our company validated these scientific discoveries and also revealed shortcomings in the initial design (i.e., low MagDot to antibody binding efficiency). The problem was solved by applying novel nanoparticle coating materials and using a more efficient bioconjugation chemistry. This knowledge could be used to further nanoparticle development in general. In addition, creation of the MagDot minimum viable product as part of this NSF funded Phase I SBIR will allow future sales of this product, in addition sales will provide a revenue stream return to the university and future inspiration for other inventors and professors to commercialize their technologies and inventions.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/29/2019<br>      Modified by: Qirui&nbsp;Fan</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773046070_Picture1--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773046070_Picture1--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 1"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773046070_Picture1--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 1"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">TEM images of MagDots with increasing loading as a result of altered process control variables.</div> <div class="imageCredit">Core Quantum Technologies, Inc.</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Copyrighted</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Qirui&nbsp;Fan</div> <div class="imageTitle">Figure 1</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773159728_Figure2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773159728_Figure2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Figure 2"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1746540/1746540_10526906_1548773159728_Figure2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Figure 2"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Comparison of commercial PE antibodies to 610 nm MagDots.
