<AbstractNarration>This grant is to give partial support to convene the 2017 Week of the Arctic in Fairbanks, Alaska, USA. This event will be a gathering of researchers, policy makers, and stakeholders from around the Arctic and the world, to share their observations and intentions, their understandings, and their challenges so that we may make greater scientific advances, more informed decisions, and better use limited research and planning resources. This event will occur at the time when the chairmanship of the international Arctic Council changes from the US to Finland and will provide an appropriate opportunity to profile the many products and accomplishments attained under US chairmanship, while planning and engaging in the coordination of future research efforts in this dynamic region of the planet.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;There will be dozens of activities associated with this meeting, and each will advance some aspect of Arctic science, engineering, technology and/or policy. The event is designed to optimize interpersonal communications that are often the essential precursor to new collaborations, new positions for students, and greater understanding for all.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The Arctic Council Ministerial draws ministerial level officials, and consequently a very large press contingent. This effort will take full advantage of this access to international journalists to maximize outreach and promote science further that documents the importance of the Arctic</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The Week of the Arctic was separated by the events held in Fairbanks, called the "Arctic Interchange" and the events in Anchorage, called North by North.  Many of the events were live streamed and a permanent archive of all events is hosted here: http://akarctichost.org/ .  The intent of this conference was to provide an opportunity to demonstrate the achievements of the US scientific community, while planning and engaging in the coordination of future research efforts in this dynamic region of the planet. We convened 15 symposiums, panel discussions, workshops and community public presentations, all intended to advance the scientific and technical understanding of Arctic processes and practices. The speakers and topics for these sessions were selected to present updates on recent achievements but also to highlight future research needs.  The value of hosting numerous complementary meetings is both broadly obvious and yet difficult to explicitly define.  The support from NSF was used to support the events associated with the Arctic Interchange, held here in Fairbanks concurrently with the final Ministerial of the Arctic Council. Fairbanks and the University of Alaska Fairbanks partnered to present over 40 different scientific and cultural events to the more than 1000 participants.  Many were social, such as the "I Am Inuit" art project featured in the UAF Art Gallery and Anchorage Museum that documented the humanity of the Inupiat and Yupiit of Alaska. Several were targeted upon the economies of northern countries, drawing comparisons between Alaska, Canada, Norway and Iceland.
