<AbstractNarration>This proposal requests for funding to support three students' travel to attend a workshop called "In Whose Best Interest? Exploring the Real, Potential, and Imagined Ethical Concerns in Privacy-Focused Agenda", co-located with the 20th ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Cooperative Work and Social Computing (CSCW 2017) to be held in Portland, OR from Feb 25-Mar 1, 2017.  CSCW is a top-tier social computing conference, and this workshop is part of an ongoing series of CSCW workshops broadly on the topic of "networked privacy", i.e., that privacy is not just an individual concept but one that can be thought about at the levels of dyads, families, groups, organizations, and communities.  Students from a variety of disciplines will participate in the workshop and the conference, giving them an opportunity to interact with senior researchers in their intellectual communities and expose them to a wide range of work in the field.  As such, it fits closely with the goals of NSF's Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, both its intellectual merit goals around analyzing privacy as a collective as well as an individual property, and its broader impact goals around growing the privacy and security research community.</AbstractNarration>

Intellectual Merit: By attending the workshop and CSCW conference, the students had the opportunity to network directly with researchers and engage with an expert panel that bridges, academia, industry, and governmental organizations.  Broader Impacts: By increasing student participation at the workshop and the CSCW conference, we hope to encourage more students to engage with ethics and privacy in user research as well as consider ethics as it relates to networked privacy research. Our goal is to encourage more students to pursue graduate education and careers in these areas.       Last Modified: 02/27/2018       Submitted by: Pamela J Wisniewski]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
