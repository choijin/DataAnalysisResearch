<AbstractNarration>This project funds a workshop for Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Biology, supported by the Research Using Biological Collections track. This track began in fiscal year (FY) 2015, and therefore three cohorts of fellows have been supported thus far. This workshop is designed to serve fellows from the first two cohorts (individuals in cohort 3 have not yet started or only recently started their fellowships, and are therefore not a part of this workshop). This project provides funds for approximately 60 fellows (all of those in cohorts 1 and 2) to attend this workshop. The purpose of the workshop is to provide a forum and networking opportunities to the fellows; expose fellows to opportunities at NSF; provide professional development opportunities and information on career tracks; synthesize information on the breadth of activities supported by collections-based research; and catalyze interactions and collaborations among fellows and with established scientists.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Biological collections have historically been an invaluable resource for research and education. In the past decade, there has been a great resurgence in the use of collections to ask broad and fundamental questions in biology. Some of this is driven by the development of new technologies, such as next-generation sequencing, stable isotopes, and new imaging technologies (e.g., DCT scans), which allow researchers to obtain novel information from specimens. In addition, many specimens have been digitized and images made available to researchers. In addition, the use of collections is now recognized as a very effective way (sometimes the only way) to address certain emerging biological questions, e.g., the impact of climate change on species distributions. The workshop will allow fellows to exchange ideas based on their research findings using collections and, more generally, to share insights into the wide range of biological questions that can be addressed using collections.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Systematic museum collections are primary scientific infrastructure in biology in biodiversity discovery and description. The key to unlocking the vast information contained in natural history archives lies in developing novel approaches to interpret, integrate, and synthesize specimens and data with emerging knowledge from other scientific fields. Much of the innovation for use of collections in novel research will be fueled by the next generation of scientists. Enhanced (digital and fluorescent) imaging of specimens is revealing new insights into morphological variation, particularly as organisms respond to changing landscapes.  Other technologies, such as Stable Isotope Analysis (SIA) and Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) are revealing an organism?s diet, evolutionary history,  and details about its interactions with the physical (abiotic) and biotic environments.  New nanotechnologies in microscopy, chemistry and physics are exploiting the diverse bio-materials and nanostructures available in natural history collections.  New bioinformatic approaches and newly web-accessible databases from NSF initiatives to digitize collections permit aggregation of specimen-associated data on unprecedented scales that, in turn, allow for retrospective and prospective quantitative analysis of biotic responses to human-mediated and natural changes over time and space. Analyzing and interpreting data across a wide range of temporal and spatial scales presents challenges that will require novel computational approaches. Because modern and future object interpretation requires knowledge from all STEM fields, the museums have become a natural nexus for multidisciplinary and integrative postdoctoral training.    We organized two three day symposia (Harvard and University of New Mexico) that brought together a diverse set of mentors and three cohorts of NSF sponsored Postdoctoral Research Fellows in Biology in the Rsearch Using Biological Collections Track to exchange research agendas, learn about new directions and innovations in specimen-based investigations, consider alternative career trajectories in the private and federal sectors and in natural history museums, develop strategies for increasing human diversity representation in STEM fields. and generally develop strategies for the next step in their professional careers. In additoin to expanded professional networks and collaborations, these meetings also resulted in two new manuscripts that draw on the fellows experiences in their postdoctoral research.
