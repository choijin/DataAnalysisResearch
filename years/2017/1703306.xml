<AbstractNarration>This award is made as part of the FY 2017 Mathematical Sciences Postdoctoral Research Fellowships Program. Each of the fellowships supports a research and training project at a host institution in the mathematical sciences, including applications to other disciplines, under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The title of the project for this fellowship to Max Engelstein is "Geometric Methods for Free Boundary Problems." The host institution for the fellowship is Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the sponsoring scientist is David Jerison.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The project was sucessful as many of the main research and career development goals were achieved.  The PI advanced our understanding of how minimizers of naturally occuring energies differ in behavior from critical points of those energies. This was done, with collaborators, by developing new tools and adapting ideas from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory to problems in the calculus of variations. Distinguishing between minimizers and critical points is important because physical phenomena in the natural world often minimize some energy but many of the methods and the theorems we have to model these phenomena concern the broader class of critical points.     The PI has also proved several results concerning equations that do not have an underlying energy. Many of these results are part of a larger, currently very active, program of understanding how solutions to PDE detect the underlying geometry of a domain. The PI, with colaborators, has applied ideas from the calculus of variations to these problems, despite their lack of a variational structure, thus opening up a new set of tools to researchers in this area.       The impact of the fellowship on the PI's career development was very positive.  The flexibility and funds that come with the fellowship allowed the PI to disseminate his work at many conferences and seminars, coming into contact with many new ideas and forming new collaborations.  In turn the PI has tried to support younger researchers while supported on this fellowship. This has taken place in the form of mentoring undergraduate research projects, giving a mini-course for graduate students in his subfield and organizing small conferences where the majority of speakers are early career researchers.
