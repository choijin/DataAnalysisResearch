<AbstractNarration>This award supports participation in an international conference which will take place in Chemnitz (Germany) on "Singularities, Toric Geometry and Differential Equations" from March 19 to March 23, 2018. The use of differential equations is an omnipresent tool in the mathematical investigation of physical, chemical and biological phenomena, and dominates engineering applications as well. The conference will bring together international experts in the areas of commutative algebra and  differential equations.  The award will provide financial support for a number of US based graduate students and postdocs to attend this conference, thereby infusing our current generation of developing researchers with the latest trends and methods of the area. Sufficiently senior graduate students will have the opportunity of showcasing their own research in a poster session.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The core of the meeting will be focused on D-modules, a mathematical area that traditionally sits between singularity theory and representation theory, but which also has intriguing ties with topology, algebraic geometry, and Hodge theory. The talks, given by international experts from around the world, will touch on hypergeometric differential equations, applications to string theory, irregularity sheaves and twistors.  Recent discoveries that will be reported on touch Stokes structures, toric geometry, Milnor fibers and topology of singularities. Further information is available at the conference website, https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~sevc/SingToric2018/</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ From March 19 to March 23, 2018 an international conference took place in Chemnitz (Germany) on "Singularities, Toric Geometry and Differential Equations". The PI of grant 1762086 was one of the organizers, together with Professor Christian Sevenheck from Chemnitz and Professor Klaus Altman from Berlin.  The use of differential equations is an omnipresent tool in the mathematical investigation of physical, chemical and biological phenomena, and dominates engineering applications as well. The conference to which this proposal pertains was a meeting of international experts on the singular points of differential equations: those points where the solutions behave in erratic ways (they collide, become infinite, or chaotic).The conference did focus on the algebraic and geometric aspects of these phenomena.  The purpose of the grant was to allow a certain number of outstanding US based graduate students and postdocs to attend this conference by defraying their cost, thereby infusing our current generation of developing researchers with the latest trends and methods of the area.   The funded graduate students were given the opportunity of showcasing their own research in a poster session that formed part of the conference and allowed them to directly interact with world experts on D-modules and singularities about their own research.   Judging from feedback from the students and the senior participants, this was a success and is likely to trigger collaborations between the experts in the field and the new generation of researchers.  Further information on the conference can be found under the conference webpage  https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~sevc/SingToric2018/index.html       Last Modified: 02/04/2019       Submitted by: Hans Ulrich Walther]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
