<AbstractNarration>This award supports the creation of a legacy dataset for data collected during the DYNAmics of the Madden-julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign. The goal of DYNAMO was to observe the initiation of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO).  The MJO is a large-scale pattern of precipitation and atmospheric circulation that forms in the Indian Ocean and propagates slowly eastward affecting weather and climate across a large portion of the globe.   The campaign took place in the Indian Ocean from 1 October 2011 until 9 February 2012 and was a massive undertaking involving ships, aircraft, sounding systems, and an island-based radar "supersite".  Several US agencies and international partners were involved, as documented in the abstract for NSF award AGS-1022899.  The campaign was a success in that three MJO events occurred during the deployment, of which the first occurred during the Special Observing Period when all the field assets were deployed together. Overall about 10 terabytes of data were collected.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Given the success of the campaign and the large investments made in it, a further investment is warranted to enhance the accessibility of the campaign data and facilitate its used by the research community.  Three categories of data products will be developed on this award, characterized by the type of instrumentation used to collect the observations: radar-based, aircraft-based, and sounding-based products.  A fourth category consists of data products processed in ways consistent with specific interests of the research community, for instance sounding data processed into variables like precipitable water, convective available potential energy, convective inhibition, lifting condensation level, and the level of free convection.  The entire collection will be hosted by the Earth Observing Laboratory at the National Center for Atmospheric Research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project is somewhat unusual in that the goal is to develop and serve a dataset for the research community, rather than to conducted research to address a scientific hypothesis. Thus all of the effort can be regarded as a broader impact to the research community. It should also be noted that the MJO has a number of societal consequences, as it is a dominant driver of weather in the tropics and also affects on the US.  Among other impacts, the MJO influences the number of hurricanes that form in the Gulf of Mexico. Research leading to better representation of the MJO in weather forecasting models is thus desirable. In addition, the data products will facilitate research on tropical convection in general, which will be of value for developing better models to predict weather and make projections of future climate change.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The DYNAmics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation (DYNAMO) field campaign collected unprecedent observations to better understand the MJO convective initiation and eastward propagation over the tropical Indian Ocean in 2011-2012. The observations have been organized into a DYNAMO Legacy Data Product (DLDP) since 2017. This project addresses two challenges not only for the DYNAMO, but field campaign data in general: 1) easy access to unified data sets with an intuitive and interactive interface (Fig. 1), and 2) field data from the ocean and atmospheric communities together. &nbsp;We developed an interactive, user-friendly interface (https://orca.atmos.washington.edu/~bkerns/dynamo_legacy/), bundles all observations from different sensors and platforms within periods and regions selected by users for download via links, scripts, or OpenDAP in a uniform format (NetCDF). We added the oceanic observations to the original DYNAMO legacy data. Users can access and download DYNAMO DLDP that includes all aircraft, radar, sounding network, surface atmosphere and ocean, and subsurface ocean data along with documentations via the graphical interface. DLDP has other new, user-friendly features. For example, all surface-based and shipborne radar data are regridded to the Cartesian Coordinates, which are convenient for applications in model-observation inter-comparisons.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In addition to the development of the DYANAMO DLDP interface, we have produced two peer-reviewed publications. Kerns and Chen (2018a) uses the DYNAMO DLDP to study the diurnal cycle of the precipitation and cloud clusters in the ITCZ and the MJO. Kerns and Chen (2018b) evaluate the satellite surface wind data using the DYNAMO DLDP, which demonstrates one of the important applications of the legacy data.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The user-friendly interface for DYNAMO DLDP has two most important and unique features that have broad and long-lasting impacts. First, it provides one-stop shopping for all platforms data from aircraft, surface stations, ship, and buoys. This has helped bringing the traditional divide between the atmosphere and ocean communities to facilitate and enhance interdisciplinary research. &nbsp;Second, it provides a classroom-ready tool box for education and training purposes.
