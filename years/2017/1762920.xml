<AbstractNarration>As part of its overall strategy to enhance learning in informal environments, the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments. This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This RAPID project was submitted in response to the NSF Dear Colleague letter (NSF 17-128) related to Hurricane Harvey along the Gulf Coast.  The PBS NewsHour team will produce 9 stories for national distribution using multiple broadcast and online channels that will engage the public and increase their understanding of the science and engineering research being conducted to better predict and mitigate the impact of future storms.  Hurricane Harvey was the first of several storms in 2017 that hit first Texas then Florida and the Caribbean creating unprecedented devastation.  This project aims to help the public better understand the science behind storms, and how scientists and engineers are actively collecting data, developing new models, using new technologies, and studying the environmental recovery.  The PBS NewsHour team has in place experienced science journalists, production facilities, and a distribution network that can quickly develop media stories based on the work of scientists and engineers in the field, many of whom are funded by NSF.  The NewsHour has a strong track record of telling stories that are scientifically accurate yet highly engaging and understandable to a diverse audience.  Researchers from several universities including Texas A&amp;M, Rice University, and Norfolk State University are advising the NewsHour team and may also be featured in some of the media. The team will also use their existing collaboration with education researchers at New Knowledge, Inc. to seek audience feedback on proposed/produced media.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The potential audience reach of these stories is extensive.  Stories that are broadcast on the nightly PBS NewsHour reach 1.6 million people.  The NewsHour's website currently reaches 6 million while their YouTube channel has 40 million views.  They have a growing audience of younger viewers who mainly get their news on social media channels such as ScienceScope and Apple News.  EXTRA is another service offered just for teachers.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>With the help of the National Science Foundation Rapid Grant for coverage of Post-Harvey Research on Extreme Weather, the PBS NewsHour produced ten broadcast and nine online segments, reporting on everything from the science of predicting a hurricane's path to new technologies used to mitigate a storm's destruction. The NewsHour not only produced reports on the research into the impact of the storms, but also dug deeper to find out why these storms are seemingly growing more powerful. These segments were designed to show that there is much to be learned about natural disasters like Hurricanes Harvey, Maria, Florence and Michael beyond what can be delivered by reporters blowing in the wind.</p> <p>Key to this reporting was introducing viewers to some of the leading scientists and researchers and the work they were doing in the field to determine why the devastation was so overwhelming and what can be done to better prepare going forward. Lead NewsHour Science Correspondent Miles O'Brien flew into the eye of Hurricane Florence alongside meteorologists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and reported on how they are able to track a storm's path. After the storm made landfall, Dr. Hal Needham, a coastal hazards scientist at Marine Weather &amp; Climate, showed O'Brien how global warming may have caused Hurricane Florence to stall. O'Brien also examined new designs aimed at minimizing the impact of flooding in Florida with researchers from Florida International University and the University of Miami.</p> <p>The NewsHour paid special attention to research being conducted months after extreme weather hit. Five months after Hurricane Harvey, Sam Brody, a professor in Texas A&amp;M's Department of Marine Sciences, gave Correspondent Hari Sreenivasan a tour of some of Houston's recent development and explained why this spike in building led to increased flooding during the storm and what could be done to improve the results in the future. &nbsp;Sreenivasan also spoke to those trying to mitigate the fact that those still suffering from the storm's impact were mostly minorities and poor people.</p> <p>Six months after Hurricane Maria, Science Producer Nsikan Akpan traveled to Puerto Rico to examine how realistic a string of grassroots efforts to jumpstart the grid with solar energy were: &nbsp;Manuel Rodriguez Martinez, a professor at the University of Puerto Rico, was his guide.&nbsp;</p> <p>And two months after Hurricane Florence, Correspondent Cat Wise looked at new and innovative ways to identify pathogens in floodwaters left behind by the storm: she accompanied Rachel Nobel from the University of North Carolina and David Johnson and Rett Newton of Duke University into the water, as they experimented with new testing methods and drone technology.</p> <p>The nine posts created for the NewsHour website tackled a wide range of topics related to the broadcast segments, including a look at why Hurricane Michael took forecasters by surprise, how climate change has intensified hurricane rainfall, and why it is difficult to test for waterborne diseases in flood zones.</p> <p>The broadcast and online productions for this Rapid Grant generated over 160,000 page views and over 65,000 video views on YouTube and the PBS viewer. On Twitter, they earned over 506,000 impressions and over 43,000 video views and on Facebook over 57,000 engagements. Three videos posted on Facebook gained another 106,000 views. These numbers are in addition to the almost 1.9 million people who are reached nightly by the NewsHour broadcast.</p> <p>After all the NewsHour productions had been completed, New Knowledge Organization tested reactions of adults gathered through TurkPrime to two of the Florida segments, and to the reports from North Carolina and Puerto Rico. After viewing the segments, respondents were positive about all four of the pieces, saying that they were satisfied with their length and ease of understanding, and had found the pieces timely and relevant. Those surveyed commented that they were particularly taken with how technology can be helpful in disasters and with being able to learn more about how NOAA makes its predictions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 01/30/2019<br>      Modified by: Patti&nbsp;Parson</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"> <div class="each-gallery"> <div class="galContent" id="gallery0"> <div class="photoCount" id="photoCount0">          Images (<span id="selectedPhoto0">1</span> of <span class="totalNumber"></span>)           </div> <div class="galControls" id="controls0"></div> <div class="galSlideshow" id="slideshow0"></div> <div class="galEmbox" id="embox"> <div class="image-title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="galNavigation" id="navigation0"> <ul class="thumbs" id="thumbs0"> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895667700_Extremeweatherimage6--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895667700_Extremeweatherimage6--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Testing the waters"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895667700_Extremeweatherimage6--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Testing the waters"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">UNC's Rachel Noble tests for pathogens two months after Hurricane Florence</div> <div class="imageCredit">PBS NewsHour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patti&nbsp;Parson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Testing the waters</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548894978810_Extremeweatherimage4--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548894978810_Extremeweatherimage4--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Flying into Hurricane Florence"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548894978810_Extremeweatherimage4--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Flying into Hurricane Florence"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">NOAA scientists and engineers on board the WP-3D Orion plane, preparing to track Hurricane Florence</div> <div class="imageCredit">PBS NewsHour</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patti&nbsp;Parson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Flying into Hurricane Florence</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895814228_Extremeweatherimage2--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895814228_Extremeweatherimage2--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Houston development and flood risk"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548895814228_Extremeweatherimage2--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Houston development and flood risk"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">During Hurricane Harvey, the water would have been over Texas A&M's Sam Brody and NewsHour's Hari Sreenivasan's heads.</div> <div class="imageCredit">PBS NewsHour</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patti&nbsp;Parson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Houston development and flood risk</div> </div> </li> <li> <a href="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548896161040_Extremeweatherimage5--rgov-214x142.jpg" original="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548896161040_Extremeweatherimage5--rgov-800width.jpg" title="Can solar put Puerto Rico's lights back on?"><img src="/por/images/Reports/POR/2019/1762920/1762920_10525269_1548896161040_Extremeweatherimage5--rgov-66x44.jpg" alt="Can solar put Puerto Rico's lights back on?"></a> <div class="imageCaptionContainer"> <div class="imageCaption">Solar might seem the answer to the island's problems after Hurricane Maria, but serious challenges remain</div> <div class="imageCredit">PBS NewsHour</div> <div class="imagePermisssions">Creative Commons</div> <div class="imageSubmitted">Patti&nbsp;Parson</div> <div class="imageTitle">Can solar put Puerto Rico's lights back on?</div> </div> </li> </ul> </div> </div> </div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
