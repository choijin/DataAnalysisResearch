<AbstractNarration>The goal of this project is to investigate wave forcings originating from the lower atmosphere including their sources, wave interactions and coupling, and their impacts on ionospheric/thermospheric variability. Meteorological sources of wave energy from the lower atmosphere are responsible for producing significant variability in the upper atmosphere, which impacts space weather. Vertical wave coupling is a fundamental atmospheric process that has profound effects on the variability of the ionosphere and thermosphere. &lt;br/&gt; This project will utilize existing and ongoing lidar and Incoherent Scatter Radar (ISR) observations to collectively study atmospheric waves in both the neutral atmosphere and ionosphere, and the Whole Atmosphere Model (WAM) to understand and interpret these rich datasets.  In particular, the project will focus on characterizing 1-9 h period gravity waves by comparing observations with simulations in terms of magnitude, vertical and horizontal wavelengths, propagation direction, and latitudinal distribution. The tidal modulation of fast gravity waves will also be studied, and the source regions identified.</AbstractNarration>
