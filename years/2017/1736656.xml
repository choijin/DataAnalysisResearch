<AbstractNarration>This research project will identify biological sources and chemical structures that are responsible for the long-term storage of carbon in the ocean. Each year, microscopic marine plants remove about as much carbon dioxide from the atmosphere as do land plants. Respiration returns much of this carbon to the ocean as carbon dioxide, but some is locked in the remnants of living organisms. These remaining compounds are modified by pathways that involve bacteria, sunlight, chemical reactions, and other processes that lead to storage of carbon for thousands to millions of years. Some compounds eventually contribute to the petroleum reservoir. Building on previous results, this project will study the reactions and oceanic lifetime of a particular set of biochemicals, called carotenoids, as a possible organic carbon storage pathway. Carotenoids are abundant in very many marine organisms, increasing the likelihood that they are part of this long-term carbon storage and petroleum formation. These compounds also have unique chemical properties that make them subject to specific chemical reactions. For this reason, they have been marketed as powerful antioxidants. Therefore, scientific outcomes from this research on carotenoid chemistry will not only inform ocean carbon cycles but could also benefit studies of their properties as antioxidants. The project will determine the lifetime of carotenoids and their degradation products in seawater to provide new insights into pathways that transfer carbon from the atmosphere through biota and into long-term storage reservoirs. Graduate students and underrepresented undergraduate students will be engaged in the research.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Previous work has identified specific chemical backbones of compounds that are broadly distributed within the marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) reservoir. A high-resolution analytical approach that combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy with comprehensive gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) has detected DOM compounds with unique structures closely related to carotenoids. Photochemical reactions of a representative carotenoid in laboratory experiments has further linked compounds detected in seawater to carotenoid degradation products (CDP). These preliminary studies show promise that the work funded here will be able to identify specific CDP structures and establish the quantitative significance, lifetimes, and timescales of CDP accumulation in seawater. The project will combine laboratory experiments, high resolution analyses, and chemical synthesis methods to determine the chemical composition of CDP and their abundance in seawater. The novel analytical methods developed through this research will be relevant for other carotenoid-focused studies in petroleum formation, soil chemistry, as well as food chemistry. Ramped pyrolysis oxidation (PyrOx) coupled to radiocarbon measurements will be used to determine the radiocarbon content of CDP-enriched DOM and seek to estimate the accumulation timescale of these dissolved molecules in the environment, and it is hypothesized that deeper, older ocean water will contain a relatively higher proportion of radiocarbon-depleted CDP. Collecting samples from different depths in the North Pacific Ocean where CDP-enriched DOM will be isolated following established sample processing methods will provide insights and new information on the mechanisms that control the amount and timescale of carbon redistribution among Earth?s various reservoirs.</AbstractNarration>
