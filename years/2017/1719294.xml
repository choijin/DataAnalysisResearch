<AbstractNarration>This award supports the conduct of an National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program Proposal Writing Workshop. The workshop will be held in Portland, Oregon, on April 3 and 4, 2017. It is expected that there will be about 250 attendees. The workshop will have a one-and-a-half-day format including a training session on good proposal writing practices, talks by previous CAREER awardees, a mock CAREER proposal panel review, and a review session during which the attendees will have a chance to obtain reviews on project summaries of their own draft CAREER proposals. The attendees will also have an opportunity to interact with NSF Program Directors both one-on-one and in mock panels.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This workshop will help to prepare young faculty for careers in education by giving them tools and skills of good proposal writing and by preparing them to write and submit better CAREER proposals. The results of the workshop include training for young faculty, better opportunity for young faculty with an emphasis on women and minority faculty, higher award success rates for the attendees, and ultimately better research resulting from better written proposals.</AbstractNarration>

During the Workshop, NSF program directors and recent NSF CAREER awardees shared their insight and experience on how to write a winning proposal. The participants were then grouped into individual mock review panels that are designed to simulate the actual proposal review process at NSF. This experience requires intensive participation and facilitates deeper learning and reflection by each participant.  Participants updated their project summaries for their own CAREER proposals based on what they learned during the first day of the workshop.  These summaries were shared with participants in their small groups.  Participants both gave feedback to other participants to improve their Project Summary and received constructive criticism on their own Project Summary.  This workshop created an environment to promote and facilitate collaborations among the Workshop participants. These collaborations are likely to positively affect their future career development as researchers.  Workshop Evaluation  A survey was conducted immediately after the workshop to gather participants? evaluation of the workshop.  187 of the 234 attendees participated in the survey. The following results are highlighted:  What did you learn? 99 percent of the participants who rated the workshop rated what they learned from the workshop as either a four or five on a five point scale (5 is Very Satisfactory and 1 is Very Unsatisfactory).  Will you recommend the workshop? 99 percent of the attendees who completed the survey gave a very positive response to the question of whether they would recommend this workshop to future CAREER proposal submitters. Altogether, 163 of the 187 respondents said they would "Definitely" (5 out of 5) recommend the Workshop to future CAREER proposal submitters and 22 more attendees gave a rating of 4 out of 5 on this scale.  What is your overall rating of the workshop? 185 attendees (99 percent) gave an overall rating of the Workshop as "Very Good? or "Excellent."  Post Workshop Results Since the Completion of the Workshop until July 2018  Ten of the workshop participants have received CAREER Awards through July 2018.  Furthermore, 44 of the workshop participants have received their first NSF award of any kind since the conclusion of the workshop.
