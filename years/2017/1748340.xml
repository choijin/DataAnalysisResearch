<AbstractNarration>This project aims to create a community of practice among the five pilot projects funded under the Geoscience Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity (GOLD) program.  The proposed work will create a website portal for all the GOLD projects.  The website portal developed will allow for linkages between the various GOLD projects, as well as serve as a platform for discussion and communication among the teams.  Repositories for background reading on diversity, success stories, evaluation reports and publications will all be components of the website portal.   This project will also create the opportunity for professional development and support to the PIs engaged on GOLD Projects. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The support of GOLD PIs and participants continues the development of diversity leaders within the geoscience community. Specifically, the goals for the project support are to 1) establish a community of practice, 2) provide skill and professional development opportunities, 3) provide customized project support, 4) promote individual and team reflection, 5) foster ownership and integrate change through collaborative outcome identification, and 6) provide consultation resources from customized follow-up.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The current project, Geoscience Opportunities for Leadership in Diversity and Equity Network (GOLDEN), uses a revolutionary new approach to provide professional development interventions for principal investigators and senior personnel of the recently funded NSF GOLD projects. These interventions are aimed at increasing the skills, knowledge, and leadership capacity of GOLD project teams, particularly in change management, leadership, and content knowledge about diversity and inclusion. Because geoscientists are at the forefront of many of the world&rsquo;s most pressing issues &ndash; from climate change to natural disaster prediction &ndash; this project has the potential to not only promote full inclusion or marginalized groups, but improve quality of life for all citizens. To that end, GOLDEN has as its overall goal to empower GOLD project team leaders to positively impact diversity and inclusion in the geosciences. The premise of GOLDEN is that for Broadening Participation projects to be fully successful, the Principal Investigators and senior staff who design and implement these efforts must continue their own development and be fully resourced to address the challenges associated with diversity, equity, and inclusion and institutional change. GOLDEN is being implemented through two main objectives: 1) Development of a support framework to provide professional development for GOLD leaders, develop a community of practice for further learning, and provide expertise and feedback to programs and leaders on their strategies, personal growth, pedagogy, impacts and outcomes; and 2) Development of a centralized website to coordinate programs, enhance communication, provide pathways between programs for participants, and collectively share resources, lessons learned, and expertise. Goal 1 was met and closed out in year 1 of the grant. This report addresses the additional work conducted in year 3 towards goal 2.</p><br> <p>            Last Modified: 10/15/2020<br>      Modified by: Hanne&nbsp;Mauriello</p> </div> <div class="porSideCol"></div> </div>]]></DRECONTENT>
