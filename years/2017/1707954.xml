<AbstractNarration>We have entered a new age of human exploration of the universe: the age of gravitational-wave astronomy. Gravitational waves are ripples in the fabric of spacetime that carry information about distant astrophysical objects.  The observation of binary black hole mergers by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) has confirmed a one-hundred-year-old prediction of Einstein. We can now use gravitational waves to study the universe. Gravitational waves carry information that can tell us what happens when black holes collide, how massive stars die, how heavy elements form, how gravity works, and how the universe evolved. This group will continue the development of data analysis techniques used to extract signal from instrumental noise. In particular, the group's studies concentrate on signals generated by binary systems composed of black holes and/or neutron stars. The new methods accelerate the detection by making efficient use of computer resources available to LIGO and provide estimations of the parameters of the binary such as masses and rates of rotation. Gravitational-wave astrophysics offers exciting opportunities to inspire and educate students of all ages, strengthening both the diversity and competitiveness of U.S. secondary and college students, and improving the scientific literacy of the general public. The computational methods developed through this award are transferable to many areas of science and technology.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award directly supports Advanced LIGO's mission to detect gravitational waves from merging neutron stars and black holes. Black holes and neutron stars are nature's most compact objects and their collisions are a transformative laboratory for fundamental physics and astrophysics. The highly relativistic speeds and strongly-curved spacetimes of compact object mergers generate gravitational waves that encode the properties of the objects as they collide: how massive they are, how far away they are, and how fast they spin. These properties can then be used to understand how massive stars live and die. This award will support research to improve the sensitivity of Advanced LIGO's compact binary searches and develop next-generation parameter-measurement techniques to extract the physics from observed signals. The proposed project will continue to drive the development of scientific workflow tools and high-throughput computing that will have broad impact across the scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ On the morning of August 17, 2017, a ripple in space passed through our planet. It was detected by the LIGO and Virgo gravitational wave detectors. This cosmic disturbance came from a pair of city-sized neutron stars colliding at one third the speed of light. The energy of this collision surpassed any atom-smashing laboratory on Earth.  Hearing about the collision, astronomers around the world, including us, jumped into action. This award directly supported that effort.

Just like the embers of an intense campfire grow cold and dim, the afterglow of this cosmic fire quickly faded away. Within days the visible light faded away, leaving behind a warm infrared glow, which eventually disappeared as well. But in this fading light was encoded the answer to the age-old question of how gold is made.  Shine sunlight through a prism and you will see our sun’s spectrum &ndash; the colors of the rainbow spread from short wavelength blue light to long wavelength red light. This spectrum contains the fingerprints of the elements bound up and forged in the sun. Each element is marked by a unique fingerprint of lines in the spectrum, reflecting the different atomic structure.  For the first time, humans had seen alchemy in action, the universe turning matter into gold. And not just a small amount: This one collision created at least 10 Earths’ worth of gold. You might be wearing some gold or platinum jewelry right now. Take a look at it. That metal was created in the atomic fire of a neutron star collision in our own galaxy billions of years ago &ndash; a collision just like the one seen on August 17.  And what of the gold produced in this collision? It will be blown out into the cosmos and mixed with dust and gas from its host galaxy. Perhaps one day it will form part of a new planet whose inhabitants will embark on a millennia-long quest to understand its origin.  This award also supported research to look inside the merging neutron stars, where gravity squeezes matter to densities several times greater than those found in the nucleus of an atom. Densities this high cannot be probed by laboratory experiments, but their physics can imprint itself on the gravitational waves radiated in the merger.  As two neutron stars orbit each radiating energy in gravitational waves, they also began raising tides on each other’s surfaces like the moon raises tides on the Earth's oceans. These tides drain more energy from the binary, causing the stars to spiral together more quickly. The strength of the tides depends on each neutron star’s internal structure and a piece of physics that is currently unknown called the "nuclear equation of state."  The PI and collaborators used a model based on a first-principles description of how subatomic particles interact at the high densities found inside neutron stars. Remarkably, these theoretical calculations at length scales less than a trillionth of a millimeter can be compared with observations of an astrophysical object more than a hundred million light years away.  This NSF award not only allowed us to use the gravitational waves from the August, 2017 neutron star merger to derive robust information on nuclear physics, but also to obtain the most stringent limits on the size of neutron stars to date.  In the next decade, the existing gravitational-wave detectors will become even more sensitive, and additional detectors will begin observing. We expect more gravitational-wave detections and possible multi-messenger observations from merging binary neutron stars. Each of these mergers would provide wonderful opportunities to learn more about neutron star and nuclear physics.        Last Modified: 10/28/2020       Submitted by: Duncan A Brown]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
