<AbstractNarration>This award is for the partial support for the NIST-ASTM-NSF-ASME workshop and competition on Formalizing Manufacturing Processes for Sustainability Assessment. The workshop will be hosted by the ASME 2017 Manufacturing Science and Engineering Conference, which will be held at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California, June 4-8, 2017. The funding will partially support the attendance of US scientists, postdoctoral researchers, and graduate students. Participating students will be selected following a competition on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. The workshop and competition will inform the manufacturing community of the ASTM E60 Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing, provide an opportunity for practitioners to put the standards into practice when modeling processes of interest, and provide a source of candidate models to populate the repository that will be developed by NIST and its partners for the use of the manufacturing community.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This award will partially support the participation of junior participants, including graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, early career faculty members, and, especially, women and under-represented minority students and faculty. The workshop focuses on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. All manufacturing processes, whether batch, continuous, or discrete event type, and all size scales, nano- to macro-manufacturing, will be considered. Models can span from traditional scale down to nanoscale processes and be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies. Since sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost, time and environmental considerations, many different types of process performance metrics may be considered. It is anticipated that the workshop and associated modeling competition will advance the field of advanced manufacturing and its relationship to sustainability to a significant extent.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Manufacturing is a critical sector of the US economy.  To remain globally competitive, advanced manufacturing technology must become increasingly "smarter." This technology must include decision analytics and manufacturing process models, to enable manufacturing processes to become more efficient, agile, cost effective and sustainable.    This NSF project provided funding in the amount of $30,000 to support the organization and twenty student and young faculty travel stipends to the NIST-ASTM-NSF-ASME workshop and competition on Formalizing Manufacturing Processes for Sustainability Assessment. The workshop was hosted by the ASME 2017 Manufacturing Science an d Engineering Conference, and held June 4-8, 2017 at University of Southern California, LA.  The workshop focused on modeling of manufacturing processes for system level sustainability assessment. Any size scale and manufacturing process type (batch, continuous, and discrete event) was acceptable. Models can span from traditional scale down to nanoscale processes and be based on mechanical, electrical, chemical, biochemical, and bio technologies. Since sustainability is a balance of competing objectives, including cost and time as well as environmental considerations, many different types of process performance metrics may be considered.  In addition, the use of the models for system-level sustainability performance is encouraged.  Formal methods for acquiring and exchanging information about manufacturing processes will lead to consistent characterizations and help establish a consolidated repository for reuse of these models. Standard methods will ensure effective communication of computational analytics and sharing of sustainability performance data.  The purpose of this workshop and competition was to (1) familiarize the research community with recent standards from ASTM E60 Subcommittee on Sustainable Manufacturing for modeling manufacturing processes,  including the recently published ASTM E60 Standard Guide for Characterizing Environmental Aspects of Manufacturing Processes; (2) provide an opportunity for participants to put those standards into practice in modeling processes of their own interest, and to share experiences in applying the standards; and, (3) provide a source of candidate models to populare an extensible repository of reusable manufacturing process models being developed by NIST and its academic partners.    The outcomes of the workshop and competition include a library of unit manufacturing process models, contributed by the workshop and competition participants, and a report on the road map for the development of a public reusable repository of manufacturing models.
