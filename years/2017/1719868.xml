<AbstractNarration>1719868&lt;br/&gt;Lastoskie&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The biannual Association of Environmental Engineering and Science Professors (AEESP) Research and Education Conference is the flagship event of the organization for members to discuss novel research and educational activities and to develop professional competencies. The conference serves as a venue for exchange of information among academics and practitioners, particularly relating to advancement of innovative research and preparation of students for professional practice in environmental engineering and science.  This conference, which has the theme of "Advancing Healthy Communities," is scheduled to be held on June 20-22, 2017, and will be hosted on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The 2017 AEESP meeting will be organized by a core council composed of faculty members from the University of Michigan, the lead institution, and five partnering universities (Michigan State University, Wayne State University, Michigan Technological University, University of Toledo, and University of Notre Dame). It is anticipated that 600 faculty, students, and guests will attend the conference. As in previous AEESP meetings, topical programming at the 2017 AEESP Research and Education Conference will address a broad spectrum of environmental engineering and science themes, including drinking water treatment; environmental microbiology for wastewater treatment; management of aging water supply infrastructures; remediation of contaminated soils and brownfields; community resilience to climate change; material and energy recovery from waste streams; urban air quality; environmental education in the developing world; integration of design into environmental engineering; and ethics and risk communication on matters of public health. The conference location and its theme of advancing healthy communities has particular relevance in the recent aftermath of the drinking water crisis in Flint, Michigan. In addition to technical programming themed on advances in water treatment technologies and water supply infrastructure management, presentations concerning ethics, education, and risk communication in relation to public health will be a key component of the 2017 AESSP meeting. The AEESP meeting offers a sizable cohort of undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students the opportunity to deliver oral and poster presentations on their research to the environmental engineering and science academic community. Junior and prospective faculty members attending the conference will benefit from workshops on how to find a faculty position, apply for the NSF CAREER award, and achieve success in their teaching and research activities. Scholarly advancements in environmental research and education will be published in a special issue of the journal Environmental Engineering Science. In summary, the 2017 AEESP Conference will promote the broad dissemination of important research and education achievements relating to the conference theme of "Advancing Healthy Communities".</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ A three-day conference was held from June 20 to 22, 2017 in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  The meeting was hosted at the Michigan League on the University of Michigan campus, with 742 participants in attendance.  The conference featured research and education presentations on subjects in environmental engineering and science organized into two plenary lectures; two poster sessions with over 250 presenters; and more than 200 podium presentations distributed across eight parallel technical sessions.  Twelve workshops were also held on the first day of the conference, including two sessions related to research and grant opportunities at the National Science Foundation.  Funding provided for participant support costs at the meeting enabled graduate and postdoctoral students the opportunity to deliver podium and poster presentations on their research and instructional activities; to attend career development workshops; and to network with academic experts and fellow students in their fields of scholarly pursuit.   The AEESP Conference is the premier technical meeting for environmental engineering and science faculty and their academia-bound students to gather to present their most recent scholarly work on research and education in water and wastewater treatment; air pollution control; contaminant fate and transport; nutrient cycling and resource recovery; water resource management; and a host of other key environmental engineering and science subject areas.  The research findings and educational innovations presented in the technical sessions at the AEESP Conference have collateral benefit in advancing knowledge and practices in disciplines related to environmental engineering and science, including public health; microbiology; materials engineering; climate science; and cross-cutting topics such as the food-water-energy nexus.  The project funding enabled the participation of graduate students, postdoctoral students, and assistant professors at the conference, where they had the opportunity to present their findings to peers in the AEESP community, network with fellow conference attendees, and receive mentoring in the career development workshops held on the first day of the meeting.  As part of the 2017 AEESP Conference theme of "Advancing Healthy Communities", the public was invited to attend the two plenary lectures that were held at the conference on subjects of broad community interest; namely, the role of academia in public discourse about the environment, and the development of practical low-cost solutions to address air pollution in impoverished developing countries.
