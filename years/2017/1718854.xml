<AbstractNarration>With over 2 billion users worldwide and over 2 million applications (apps) each in Google and Apple's digital marketplaces, smartphones have advanced human society into the mobile era.  Despite the far-reaching societal impact of smartphones, the user experience has been severely limited by smartphone battery life. The obvious idea of extending smartphone battery life is to improve the battery technology, which, however, has stagnated in the past 15 years, and battery capacity is generally viewed as nearing the limits of physics. Instead, this project pursues a course of research to significantly extend smartphone battery life by reducing the energy drain of various software running on the smartphone.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project aims to tackle a major smartphone battery drain contributor, app energy drain when running in the foreground, with the goal of reducing it by 2x. The proposed research includes major thrusts that will develop the first set of prescriptive energy profiling techniques that will transform energy profiling from a "passive" app development step into a "proactive" process: (a) It will develop the first capability to automatically uncover the causal relationship between parameter configurations and framework/library method invocations, a unique and hard program analysis problem in framework-based mobile  programming; (b) It will develop the first capability to automatically identify an energy-efficient  implementation of similar tasks, a generally intractable problem but attainable for mobile apps by comparing similar apps that are widely available in the huge mobile app marketplace.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The importance of this project is heightened by smartphones being an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence being an important tool in overcoming the "digital divide".  Technically, this work will have a far-reaching impact outside of the area of developing energy efficient mobile apps by increasing compiler capabilities for general event-driven computer programs. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;A project repository will be maintained to provide access to code, raw experimental data showcasing the effectiveness of the developed techniques, and processed results and technical publications. The repository will be maintained during the three-year project period and the two years afterwards, to foster research activities by others in this important area.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ With over 2 billion users worldwide and over 2 million apps each in Google and Apple's digital marketplaces, smartphones have permanently advanced human society into the mobile era. Despite the far-reaching societal impact of smartphones, the user experience has been severely limited by phone battery life. The obvious idea of extending smartphone battery life by improving the battery technology, has stagnated in the past 15 years and the capacity of current mobile battery technology is generally viewed as nearing the limits of physics. Instead, this proposal pursues a course of research to significantly extend smartphone battery life by reducing the energy drain of various software running on the smartphone.     Intellect Merits:     The proposed research targets key technical challenges in helping app developers to create energy-efficient mobile apps: (1) It has developed the first set of prescriptive energy profiling techniques that will transform energy profiling from a ``passive'' app development step into a ''proactive'' process, and hence lower the barrier to adopting energy profiling into the app development process by mobile app developers. (2) It has developed the first capability (DiffProf) to automatically identify an energy-efficient implementation of similar tasks, a generally intractable problem but attainable for mobile apps by diffing similar apps that are (i) widely available in the huge mobile app marketplace, and (ii) built upon common framework services provided by the mobile OS. (3) It has developed the first mobile app energy profiler (ConfigProf) that largely automates the process of identifying the app parameters, out of potentially thousands of parameters per app, that when taking on different values can result in different app energy drain, and exposing them to app developers who can easily tune their values to optimize app energy drain.     Broader Impacts:  The discoveries of this work have helped to advance smartphones as an important enabler of Internet access for disadvantaged people in both developed and developing countries, and hence as an important tool in overcoming the ``digital divide". The ConfigProf framework for automatically identifying energy-tunable app parameter is being open sourced to the research community to further the research on this important problem.
