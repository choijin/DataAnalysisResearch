<AbstractNarration>Funding organizations have been very successful at selecting individual projects under the guidance of peer review. However, the growth in size and scope of R&amp;D across new thematic, sectoral and geographic areas has made it increasingly difficult to develop strategic thinking about the directions and de facto priorities of R&amp;D funding. Research portfolio approaches take an R&amp;D landscape perspective of project management to facilitate strategic thinking. Looking at the ensemble of funded projects, one may wonder if some type of relevant research is underfunded, or whether there is room for improving efficiency of the investments taking into consideration the high uncertainties of research. This project complements current management focus on R&amp;D program quality with systemic considerations on project risk, synergies and responsiveness to societal needs. It provides tools to R&amp;D program managers/decision makers to consider aggregate R&amp;D portfolios. The policy report will interpret analytical methods for better handling project risk and synergies at the program level. It will also explain methods to analyze the alignment between R&amp;D program missions and the expected societal outcomes of program portfolio.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This science policy report is based on the notion that an R&amp;D portfolio is more than the sum of the projects contained in the portfolio. The reason is that the risks of failure and project learning are not additive but multiplicative in complex ways: by considering the interactions among projects and economies of scale and scope, risks can be reduced and overall learning enhanced.  Three specific approximations are shown for portfolio management. First, methods for single-objective portfolios are developed for cases such as energy consumption in an industry or within the logic of public R&amp;D. These methods better handle technical and market uncertainty, as well as account for all stop-go decisions in the lifetime of a research project. They are based on the literature using decision trees and real options methods. Second, the project develops methods for R&amp;D programs that have multiple goals such as citizen wellbeing, the environment, and security. In such cases, the project analyses multicriteria methods  or Data Envelopment Analysis. Third, the project introduces data and visualization techniques developed in the past few years that facilitate the identification of knowledge gaps and help in making more transparent the current focus of R&amp;D investment.</AbstractNarration>

Private sector firms have increasingly done so utilizing powerful new methodological tools and large amounts of data becoming available. In contrast, with relatively few exceptions, public R&amp;D management still tends to base selection processes on the excellence of individual projects according to peers rather than considering the merits of the whole portfolio.

This report argues it is high time for public R&amp;D management to move forward. Portfolio analysis should not be applied similarly across the board. It will serve different purposes for different types of public R&amp;D programs depending on risk/uncertainty, data availability, and target clarity (ability to define unambiguous program goals). Not all methodologies will be appropriate to all programs. Nonetheless, the toolkit, data depositories, and computing capability have expanded tremendously during the past couple of decades to render such experimentation possible and absolutely necessary.  The use of research portfolios in science policy depends on the type of research and policy context. In cases where there is manageable degree of uncertainty and some value consensus, one can apply modelling techniques. In cases, with high uncertainty and lack of consensus on agreement on goals, portfolio analysis can feed into and enrich qualitative processes of priority setting.    A set of conclusions emerges from our discussion on R&amp;D portfolio modeling:  It is feasible to estimate the risk and potential return of applied R&amp;D projects. However, discounted cash flow methods (NPV) are increasingly recognized as inadequate in characterizing public applied R&amp;D investments. Alternative methods such as ?real options? allow better appraisal of the value of R&amp;D management flexibility in the presence of risk and of the differential effects on each R&amp;D project depending on the level of uncertainty and the size of the upside payoff.  Accepting that both risk and return are important compels the use of portfolio-level analysis. Risk is not additive. Frequently the returns of R&amp;D projects are not additive. Absent portfolio analysis there is no way to discern the overall risk and overall return of a set of R&amp;D investments. Portfolio analysis requires the explicit incorporation of the relationship between individual R&amp;D projects. Both technical connections and market connections are important. One can think, for example, of the opportunity to share results and the possibility of economies of scope across projects. Modelling of project relationships shows that their type affects the risk of the overall R&amp;D portfolio. Public R&amp;D programs typically have multiple objectives (ambiguity). In order to account for multiple, difficult to monetize, and often conflicting program and project goals, a diverse set of alternative mixed methods to draw up real asset portfolios (including R&amp;D) have been developed. These methods can stand on their own bottom, although they can be combined with economic quantitative approaches for addressing portfolio optimality.    Using research portfolios as a heuristic for managing research priorities leads to complementary insights:  In R&amp;D programmes characterised by multiple objectives, mixed methods outlined above for exploring ambiguities in goals and uncertainties in outcomes can be used as part of wider participatory and/or deliberative processes of priority setting in funding agencies. These wider priority setting practices require not only the development of technical expertise, but also institutional learning for managing processes of deliberation and integration of diverse knowledge sources. In recent years there has been a rapid increase in data sources that facilitate portfolio analyses of science supply, in particular in availability of funding and publication data, classification schemes and visualization techniques. However, attention must be paid to adapt data management to portfolio goals and contexts &ndash; specially the analytical categories (classifications) used. Expected outcomes of portfolios can be compared with estimates of societal needs or demands. These estimations are very challenging.  Increasing data availability in sectors such as health, agriculture and sustainability allows to develop new estimates of the societal needs addressed by research programs. Mixed method approaches can assess the diversity of views of stakeholders.  Novel data and visualizations of portfolio outputs (science supply) together with new data and methods for assessing societal needs (demand) can improve priority setting processes, in particular facilitating the participation of stakeholders in deliberations.   Finally, while not treated explicitly in this report due to space limitations, "big data" exploiting unconventional sources of information may hold a big promise in terms of estimating not easily monetized goals of public R&amp;D programs, thus deserving research attention in the future.
