<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this project relates to the management of clotting&lt;br/&gt;and bleeding which is a major clinical challenge that costs &gt; $100B healthcare system burden. In&lt;br/&gt;the United States, it affects more than ten million patients of major surgery, trauma,&lt;br/&gt;cardiovascular disease, stroke and cancers. The underlying biology is a complex orchestration of&lt;br/&gt;protein and cellular pathways that react in the context of blood flow. Proven diagnostic tools that&lt;br/&gt;capture this complexity, and also meet the constraints of diverse challenges do not exist. This&lt;br/&gt;project intends to create a novel modular hemostasis test platform using proprietary microsystem&lt;br/&gt;modules deployed in configurable cartridges tailored to meet clinical requirements. Initially a&lt;br/&gt;3D microelectrode based platelet function test module will be developed and optimized with&lt;br/&gt;potential for best in class performance following multi-scale optimization of the dynamic,&lt;br/&gt;physical diagnostic environment.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project seeks to develop a simple, low&lt;br/&gt;cost platelet function assay (PFA) with the objective of delivering best in class performance via&lt;br/&gt;multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. Multiplate Electrode&lt;br/&gt;Aggregometry (MEA), a macroscale impedance-based device has already shown promise, yet&lt;br/&gt;remains cumbersome and has suboptimal classification accuracy between patient subsets. In&lt;br/&gt;MEA tests, as with most PFAs, the role of local fluid shear and macro/microscale physical&lt;br/&gt;environment remains largely neglected despite their well-recognized role in platelet response.&lt;br/&gt;Preliminary work suggests untapped potential in controlling and modifying PFA performance.&lt;br/&gt;By optimizing these signals with respect to clinical end points and subpopulation differentiation,&lt;br/&gt;this shear-based micro-platelet function test modules stand to revolutionize platelet function&lt;br/&gt;testing for the broadest possible benefits.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[   Intellectual merit This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project seeks to develop a a shear-based micro-scale, impedance based platelet function test (microPFT) based on 3D MEMS electrodes. Platelet activation is central to arterial clot formation and triggers atherothrombotic events such as heart attack and stroke. Each year, these conditions impact 32.5 million individuals creating enormous burden to patient, provider, and payor. Our overall goal is developing a simple and low-cost yet highly sensitive and tunable platelet function assay to deliver best-in-class performance via multiscale optimization of the local biophysical diagnostic environment. In Phase I, we have fabricated the sensor and established its core functionality and uncovered r a rich optimizable multivariate design space.  Broader Impact The proposed research will significantly advance hybrid material system integration technologies to package silicon-based semiconductors for biocompatible medical applications. This fundamental innovation will incubate tremendous opportunities for semiconductor industry to further penetrate into healthcare sector and inspire continuous innovation at the intersection.   The validation of our platelet assay and its integration into our product makes the most complete solution on the market for bleeding diagnoses in critically ill patients. The ultimate integrated platform, we anticipate, will have a vast commercial impact by defragmenting and revolutionizing the coagulation/hemostasis testing sector. The expected penetration of our system will promote the adoption of point-of-care testing in clinical environments. The incorporation of flow-structure interaction in platelet function assays stands to reopen the major values of platelet function test in cardiology and stroke, once thought to be present.   Ultimately, wide adoption of our system is expected to improve clinical outcome for critically ill patients, reducing the length of hospitalization, complication, and mortality. Our product will also facilitate cost savings at many levels of healthcare, including consolidating costs of multiple test instruments/cartridges, and reducing adverse consequences in critical care that increases healthcare spending significantly.
