<AbstractNarration>The broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project is to empower individuals to understand and manage their consumption of utility provided resources such as water, electricity, and natural gas. Many regions experience shortages or constraints in delivery of these resources (short and long-term) with appreciable costs for individual consumers as well as society at large. Technology that brings high-resolution consumption data in real-time to consumers allows them to understand the price and effect of individual choices as well as the benefits to be gained by decisions to reduce, defer, and schedule consumption. Clear economic incentives exist at this consumer level that will generate 'bottom-up' benefits for society as a whole through more efficient infrastructure and resources use.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This I-Corps Cyber Physical Systems project explores commercialization potential and conducts customer discovery for technology to analyze and communicate end-user utility consumption and effects on large-scale utility infrastructure systems. This technology capitalizes on the advent of Advanced Metering Infrastructure, which allows real-time monitoring and communication of water and other utility consumption and behavior. It is comprised of a suite of information technology components for capture, assessment, and presentation of data through multiple channels, algorithms to analyze usage patterns, and additional algorithms to translate consumption patterns for system operations and infrastructure optimization needs. A pilot study implementing this technology at a water utility has found significant reductions in water usage, leading to lower customer costs; at the same time, the utility reports higher customer satisfaction. Advanced metering infrastructure represents a ubiquitous sensing technology, a class crucial to 'smart' infrastructures and cyber-physical systems.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The principal outcomes of this I-Corps project can be summarized as:  Suspension of further efforts to commercialize the MyWater web portal technology in absence of a clear value proposition. Transfer of the "Lean Launchpad" entrepreneurial method to other technologies in development including an irrigation controller. Incorporation of the I-Corps entrepreneurship method and philosophy to other educational and research activities by the project team.   The I-Corps customer search process led to the project team concluding that no quantifiable value proposition exists for the My Water technology. While potential customers at water utilities often expressed enthusiasm for the technology concept, they also stated that the advantages from its use were vague concepts such as "political capital" and "transparency." Furthermore, continued questioning of these customers found that negative incentives to adoption existed (e.g., loss of revenue), which further diminished customer prospects in this area. A pivot to viewing water meter hardware manufacturers as potential customers was attempted and several interviews from this segment were made. However, the project team found the lack of a quantifiable value proposition existed again for this segment. Without a quantifiable value proposition identified, it was determined that the project team should suspend further efforts to commercialize the technology.     The PI and EL for the MyWater project did find other potential customer needs in the I-Corps interview process. Both of these team members have joined another research project on the Texas A&amp;M campus to develop an advanced irrigation controller. Information gathered from the MyWater process is being include in this ongoing project. Additionally, the MyWater team is encouraging a "Lean Launchapd" customer discovery process to be adopted in the current project by researchers not previously exposed to I-Corps and its methods.     Both the PI and EL of the MyWater team learned a great deal about the need to conduct customer discovery and "get out of the building" for any research endeavor. The PI will be assuming an academic administration role in summer 2018 focused on new academic program development &ndash; he will explicitly use the I-Corps philosophy and methodology in that position to determine "product-market fit" and develop sustainable programs. The EL presented on the team?s experiences at a national conference (2017 UCOWR/NIWR Annual Conference) and encouraged other researchers in the water resources field to strongly consider technology commercialization and the entrepreneurial process as means to improve research outcomes.
