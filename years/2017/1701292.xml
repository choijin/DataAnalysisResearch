<AbstractNarration>A cyberphysical system (CPS) in biology requires sensor input that represents, as closely as possible, cell activity. Much work is expended on the development of wearable sensors that detect the expression of cell activity filtered through many processes. Recent work discloses that gene transcription can be thought of as a signal, with periodic oscillations over time. The well-known 24 hour light-dark cycle has protean effects however shorter and longer cycles not only exist but have important roles to play in health and disease. Detection of these signals and their perturbation is likely to be of great use in a robust health focused CPS. The exact nature of these signals and the mathematical structure underlying them will form the basis of this proposal. The societal impacts go beyond the new sensors to include the development of open source methods allowing the dissemination of new mathematical models and insights. into measurement of cellular processes.                                      &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This proposal addresses the critical problem of generating cell-level physiologic data as a substrate for an effective CPS in health.   Applying  new, unbiased signal processing techniques, the team has recently identified new periodicity in RNA over time. This signal provides a robust insight into cell function and its changes. The team will address the ability of the new techniques in specific situations  to uncover signals to be used as inputs for a human health CPS sensor. This signal processing technique will be used to identify oscillations in genes associated with defined chronic metabolic diseases of humans such as diabetes, inflammation, and cancer). These candidate genes  will be used to construct a precision signature for input into a CPS sensor. The concepts and data will be used to construct mathematical equations describing the longitudinal DNA transcripts previously identified.  Taken together, these two activities will provide an integrated mathematical picture of periodic gene transcription that then sets the stage for novel sensor design that will provide prediction and control in a human-based CPS. The project will develop a new platform for understanding the cell that will be made widely available via a Web-based open source platform.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ In this project we  have capitalized on the signal nature of gene oscillation, which forms the basis of a CPS (Cyber Physical System) input. Furthermore, using data science we have modeled gene transcription in a novel way.  These accomplishments were complemented by the realization that there were aspects of metabolomic data that were not amenable to analysis of oscillations. We have explored alternative methodologies for these data.  1. Analysis of large data sets of gene transcription and of metabolomic profiles.  2. Investigation of novel methodologies for discriminating disease groups that would be amenable to sensor development.  3. Creation of a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) to allow public access to the Eigenvalue pencil analytic method.  4. Application of the eignevalue pencil method to additional systems of gene transcription to recover signals.    Significant Objectives and Results:  1. The Eigenvalue pencil has proven useful besides gene transcription, in two additional cases not previously reported: Non-entrained oscillation in mammary epithelial cells under the influence of MYC oncogene and eludicdation of oscillations in a cell-autonomous 12 hour clock in the liver. The former finding relates to factors undelying cancer and the latter to inflammation and response to injury.   The GUI is in testing phase and dditional manuscripts are in preparation.   Two publications resulted from the above activity, one in Cell Metabolism and the second in PLoS One:  1.
