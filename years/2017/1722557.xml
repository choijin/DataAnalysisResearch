<AbstractNarration>The Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) based security primitives typically suffer from area/power overhead, sensitivity to environmental fluctuations and limited randomness and entropy offered by Silicon substrate. Spintronic circuits can complement the existing CMOS based security and trust infrastructures. This project explores ways to uncover the security specific properties of the magnetic nanowire and capture them in detailed circuit model.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project investigates noise sources and randomness present in the magnetic nanowire, and engineers new techniques to harvest the entropy. The investigators combine the circuits and models of non-linear magnetic dynamics to realize hardware security primitives and engines and experimentally validating the models and design ideas under harsh conditions and attack scenarios. The techniques developed in this project will improve the security and energy-efficiency of future circuits and systems.</AbstractNarration>
