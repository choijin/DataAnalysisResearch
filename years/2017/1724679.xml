<AbstractNarration>Engaging students in premiere scientific conferences is extremely important as we seek to increase participation in STEM and to identify and develop the next generation of scientists by engaging students in premier scientific conferences. The International Symposium on Cluster, Cloud and Grid Computing (CCGrid) is a successful series of conferences that serves as the major international forum for presenting and sharing recent research results and technological developments in the fields of Cluster, Cloud and Grid computing. The CCGrid conference series has been emphasizing a comprehensive experience for students, to better prepare students attending the conference for their professional career. The CCGrid program provides a comprehensive set of events and activities that can expose students to the state of the art in research and technologies, as well as to the leading researchers and thinkers in the field. The student program is a critical aspect of CCGrid and is anchored in this technical program and exposes students to the state of the art in research and technologies, as well as to the leading researchers and thinkers in the field. Traditionally, students have participated in all aspects of this program, including being authors and presenters on papers and posters, presented demos, and been competitors in the SCALE challenge. Additionally, the CCGrid program includes the annual CCGrid Doctoral Symposium, which provides students researchers with visibility, mentoring, and valuable feedback for their research. Participating in the conference will provide students with valuable opportunities to improve their overall research skills and planning, and thus aligned with NSF's overall mission of promoting science and advancing national prosperity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;This project will support the participation of US-based students in CCGrid 2017. Supported students will present papers or posters describing their ongoing research to the conference audience, participate in the student program and related activities, discuss their research with experts from academia and industry during the conference, and make useful contacts. Travel grants will encourage the research interests and the involvement of students in the field who are not well funded and those who are just beginning their participation in the field or are interested in entering it. Particular effort will be made to solicit applications for the travel support from female students and students from under-represented communities.</AbstractNarration>
