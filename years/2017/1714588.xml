<AbstractNarration>1264807&lt;br/&gt;Lazzara, Matthew J.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The clearance of proteins from plasma by the kidneys constitutes one of the most significant pathways leading to reduced bioavailability of protein-based therapeutics. The loss of such proteins via the renal system is greatest for proteins which are not efficiently retained by the filtration apparatus of the glomerular capillary wall and which are not efficiently reabsorbed from the primary urine within the proximal tubule. While some protein-based therapeutics have been engineered for reduced renal clearance by covalent modification or fusion to bulky inert proteins, such modifications may alter therapeutic availability to intended target tissues. The investigators propose to identify minimal epitopes within albumin that trigger the efficient proximal tubule reabsorption of this abundant plasma protein through cognate transport receptors expressed in the proximal epithelium and to use this information to engineer generic peptides that can be fused to any therapeutic protein to reduce its renal clearance by causing its intact reabsorption. The experimental aims will leverage tools within the investigators? laboratories to engineer proteins, analyze protein interactions with cells and receptors, and measure intracellular protein trafficking processes. The computational aim will leverage mass transport and kinetic modeling approaches to create a quantitative framework for predicting how changes to protein binding and endocytosis will improve therapeutic bioavailability and how to optimally engineer proteins. In addition, this project will have broader impact through integrated educational programs in which the science behind the research objectives will be disseminated to students and teachers in multiple educational settings.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Protein-based therapeutics are becoming increasingly common due to their exquisite biological functions and specificities. The investigators? work will have broad implications for enhancing therapeutic protein efficacy. Indeed, the successful engineering of the intact reabsorption of model proteins will enable the application of this technology to any protein-based therapeutic and create a fundamentally new modularity for protein-based drugs. This has potential for tremendous societal impact through enhancement of therapeutic efficacy and patient treatment regimens, as well as reduction in the financial burden associated with production and administration of protein-based drugs.</AbstractNarration>

<DRECONTENT><![CDATA[<div class="porColContainerWBG"> <div class="porContentCol"><p>The human kidneys play important roles in health, including the filtration of blood in the glomerulus and the reabsorption of desirable blood filtrate components in the tubule. The balance of these filtration and reabsorption processes is frequently disrupted in kidney diseases, and certain aspects of normal renal physiology could potentially be co-opted in novel design strategies for protein-based therapeutics. Indeed, one goal of this project was to identify reabsorption-directing peptide sequences present in proteins that are naturally reabsorbed in the tubule and to engineer those sequences for more efficient reabsorption and return of intact proteins to the circulation, with an ultimate goal of using this approach to increase the lifetimes of protein-based therapeutics in the circulation. However, we were unable to identify a distinct reabsorption-directing peptide sequence that could be used as a starting point for further protein engineering and therefore did not continue to pursue this goal. In parallel with our work on tubular reabsorption, we also made a surprising observation about the ability of specific growth factor receptors to cooperate with the receptor nephrin in driving biochemical signaling processes in specialized cells of the glomerulus called podocytes. As a result, we gathered a dataset to characterize nephrin signaling and trafficking in the context of co-activation of growth factor receptors. Using part of that dataset, we also developed a data science model of nephrin and growth factor receptor signaling in podocytes. It is anticipated that these data and the associated model will lead to new understanding of the biochemical signaling events regulated by nephrin in podocytes in both health and disease.
