<AbstractNarration>This proposal will support U.S. Ph.D. students working in robotics the opportunity to attend a Doctoral Consortium that will enable them to share their knowledge and interact with each other and more senior researchers, to learn about different sub-fields within robotics, to meet potential employers, and to become apprised of new technology that will be demonstrated by vendors. The Doctoral Consortium includes a full day of activities, including poster presentations by students, a panel on how to complete the PhD, and an interactive session on writing an NSF-style proposal.  The proposal partially supports the travel costs for U.S. Ph.D. students to attend the International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS), which is one of two major international robotics conferences co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society. The conference, which in 2017 is held in Vancouver, Canada, attracts an international crowd that includes academics, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ Robotics is increasingly important as an interdisciplinary scientific research field with significant and broad societal impact.  The national importance of the field of Robotics is evidenced by the establishment of the National Robotics Initiative (NRI) in 2012 as part of President Barack Obama?s Advanced Manufacturing Partnership Initiative.  The goal of the NRI is to "accelerate the development and use of robots in the United States that work beside, or cooperatively with, people".  By developing mechanisms and algorithms to enable robots to cooperate with people, work in robotics and automation promises to dramatically change manufacturing processes to enable significant economic growth.  This procject, entitled "Doctoral Consortium at the 2017 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS 2017),"  allowed 34 U.S. based Ph.D students to participate in the 2017 Doctoral Consortium at The IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS).  The IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems (IROS) is one of the two major international conferences in Robotics co-sponsored by the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society (IEEE-RAS) and the Robotics Society of Japan (RSJ).  It is held each year either in North America, Europe, or Asia by rotation, and is attended regularly by members of the international community including academicians, industry workers, entrepreneurs, and funding agency leaders.  IEEE IROS 2017 was held in Vancouver, BC, Canada. It provided a forum for the exchange of ideas, interaction, networking, and collaboration for research and development in robotics with special attention to the latest advances.  Attendance reached 2000+ participants. The conference attracts researchers and educators from all areas of robotics including modeling, simulation, computation, implementation, and application to present technical talks, demos, workshops, and tutorials focused on developing robot technologies and applying these technologies to a wide range of industry, including manufacturing, space, automotive, healthcare, agriculture, entertainment, etc.  This year the conference has received a record number of over 2,400 paper submissions, and 46% of those have been accepted for presentation in the main technical program. In addition, over 50 workshops/tutorials will be organized. The technical program covered the all major topics in robotics and related technology. The technical activities included: keynote/plenary presentations, parallel technical sessions, workshops and tutorials, special sessions, exhibitions, and robot challenges.     The 2017 Doctorial Consortium had three parts:  (1) Academia vs. Industry Discussion Session - An interactive discussion session between the students, a senior professor (Prof. Jacky Baltes) and an assistant professor (tenure track) with industry start-up experience (Prof. Daniel M. Lofaro). Opinions on the differences between working in industry and academia were given. A compare and contrast of being a new profession vs. being a more senior professor was given.  Students were able to ask questions and help guide the conversation.  (2) NSF proposal Development Session.  A group activity, the PI described the different major parts of an NSF proposal, their requirements, and gave some examples.  The entire DC body then worked as one large group in coming up with an idea for an NSF-NRI 2.0 proposal.  With the guidance of the PI a Project Summary was then written for the latter idea.  (3) Poster Session on thesis topic/time-line with peer-review component - Prior to the Doctoral Consortium event each student made a quadchart which had the following information a) About Me, b) Driving Hypothesis, c) Work to Date, and d) Time-line to Thesis.  These items were then presented to the group and feedback was given by a young professor, a senior professor, and the students DC peers.  Each of the 34 U.S. based Ph.D students was given travel assistance to attend the 2017 Doctoral Consortium and IROS.     Broader Impacts:  The wide variety and significance of the topics presented at IROS, in both the technical program and all the associated activities, will have a great impact on the development of human resources for all the conference attendees.  The broader impact of the 2017 Doctoral Consortium includes the involvement of US-based Ph.D graduate students in a technical conference run by major professional societies (IEEE and RSJ).  In addition to technical exposure, this experience provided the students the opportunity to interact with a broad range of researchers and educators involved in this field.  The projected funds directly impacted 34 U.S. based Ph.D students.  In addition, the student attendees attend invited symposiums, workshops, and tutorials organized by the conference where academic and industry leaders and experts examined the future of robotics and robotics education.  A diverse representation in terms of gender, ethnic background, academic institution, and geographic location were represented in the participating U.S. based Ph.D students. The most immediate beneficiaries were the US-based Ph.D graduate student researchers for whom the travel grant make it possible to attend the conference.
