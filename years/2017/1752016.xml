<AbstractNarration>Investigators will quantify shifts in aerobic respiration below the effluent discharge of a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) in an urban stream and compare these rates to community respiration rates quantified by diel oxygen methods.  The request is for the purpose of testing the use of the tracer resazurin (Raz), which irreversibly transform into resorufin (Rru) in the presence of aerobic bacteria, and whose efficacy has not been verified in urban streams.  The working theory is that urban streams are overwhelmed by nutrient additions through WWTP effluent for quite a distance downstream, reducing nutrient retention efficiency for kilometers.  The impacts on the functioning of stream ecosystems, including the ability of stream ecosystems to ameliorate anthropogenic nutrient loading are poorly understood. This study will fill a gap in quantifying WWTP impacts on the metabolism of the Wissahickon Creek, located in Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, Pennsylvania.  The investigators are two early-career scientists launching a research career.  Student volunteers involved in data collection during the stream tracer test will learn about stressors in urban streams and field characterization methods.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Investigators obtained preliminary results based on diel oxygen monitoring, indicating that even in this stream where a majority of baseflow is comprised of effluent, respiration can be as high as -13 g O2 m-2 day-1 within five kilometers of effluent discharge.  Raz-Rru injections would allow for an independent and reach-specific method of calculating instantaneous aerobic respiration.  They propose to conduct two tests at WWTPs on the Wissahickon Creek with differing effluent nutrient concentrations. The basic research question being addressed is whether the stresses of urban systems (in this case, high nutrient concentrations) inhibit or enhance metabolism, and at what temporal scale. The experiments proposed will provide a better understanding of spatial and temporal variation in metabolism, with the added benefit of evaluating a new method for determining metabolism in urban streams. The urgency of this project is controlled by their extensive probe set up for measuring dissolved oxygen, which will only be deployed in summer and fall 2017.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ We injected fluorescent dyes into a high-nutrient stream in suburban Philadelphia, PA at two different locations, each below the input from a wastewater treatment plant (WWTPs).  Our goal was to evaluate in-stream flow dynamics and metabolic activity (a measure of the biological functioning of the stream ecosystem) in order to determine if the high nutrient levels in the stream, coming from WWTP effluent, could potentially lead to higher-than-normal metabolic activity in the stream.  We hypothesized, based on nutrient concentrations, that the plant further upstream would have higher microbial activity because nutrients decreased with distance from the plant, potentially indicative of nutrients being removed from the water column to build cells.  In contrast, the plant further downstream did not show a decrease in nutrients below the WWTP, so we hypothesized we would see lower metabolic activity. Two experiments were conducted, one below each plant. During each test, two dyes were injected at a constant rate for approximately 10 hours: fluorescein, which is non-reactive and measures travel time, and resorufin (Raz) which reacts in the presence of living cells such as microbes. This was a novel use of the methodology because the Raz tracer has not been used in such high nutrient urban streams, and has rarely been used in such large streams. Volunteers collected samples from the stream every hour for five hours at locations spaced 100 to 200 m apart. In addition, in-stream fluorometers, capable of measuring the concentration of fluorescein and Raz at 10-second intervals, were placed at three locations below the injection and ran for 24 hours after the injection began.  Dissolved oxygen was also measured every 15 minutes and used to calculate metabolism at a single point in the stream. Lab analysis was conducted on grab samples for dye concentrations and nutrient concentrations, specifically nitrogen and phosphorous.  As hypothesized, the dye showed that metabolic activity was higher in the upper reach, where nutrient concentrations declined with distance, compared to the lower reach where they did not change over the reach.  However, when compared to rates in natural streams, both sites had low rates of metabolism, and in the lower reach, rates of metabolic activity were lower than any reported in the literature using this method.  We also saw that at each site, metabolic activity decreased over the afternoon, from noon to 5 pm.  This is in contract to efficiency of nitrate removal, which showed an increase in rate over the afternoon.  Daily estimates of in-stream ecosystem respiration from dissolved oxygen concentrations showed higher metabolic activity compared to natural stream. This suite of contrasting indications of metabolic activity depending on the method and timescale still needs to be resolved with further research.        Intellectual merit:  Several conditions make this experiment unique from past applications of resazurin to study stream metabolic activity. In streams, Raz is more typically used as a slug (single-time) injection and not as a long-term, constant rate injection, as was done here. Conducting a longer-term constant rate injection helps integrate the multitude of hydrologic flow paths water takes and may give a more reasonable, integrated estimate of metabolic activity. A plateau injection also allowed us to evaluate metabolic activity on an hourly basis, something not possible with a slug injection or traditional DO-based metabolism measurements. Further, Raz dye has not been utilized in streams of such high nutrient concentrations. Our tests add to the body of knowledge that indicates high nutrient concentrations lead to a decrease in metabolic activity in streams.     Broader impacts:  Citizen science volunteers from the Wissahickon Valley Watershed Association assisted with both injection tests, along with numerous Earth and Environmental Science graduate students.  Approximately 80 K-12 students observed our second injection test at Germantown Academy and chatted with the students and scientists conducting the test.  Because of the highly visible nature of the tests (fluorescein dye is fluorescent green), public outreach was conducted through local and county governments and watershed non-profits.  The mayor of Ambler and Germantown Academy wrote Facebook posts about the tests, and Philadelphia Magazine and the Philly Voice posted about the experiment on their websites. Flyers were also posted along the popular trail that parallels the Creek to explain what was happening.  These activities and posts generated public interest in scientific studies to evaluate stream health.           Last Modified: 10/31/2018       Submitted by: Sarah H Ledford]]></POR_COPY_TXT>
