<AbstractNarration>The ultimate goal of this EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project is to develop a crossdomain multiscale network and interdependent critical infrastructure (ICI) generator that captures many features of real networks and incorporates an arbitrarily large or small degree of stochasticity. Starting from samples of known or hypothesized networks, the generator will synthesize ensembles of networks and ICIs that will preserve, on average, a diverse set of topological and physical design properties at multiple scales of its structure. These properties will include several measures of centrality, assortativity, path lengths, clustering, flows, required physical capacities, and modularity. This approach introduces an unbiased variability across the ensemble in many of these properties at multiple scales which creates a desired realism of the synthesized system. The models will include human factor components incorporated in both topological and physical designs. A toolbox of algorithms and heuristics for generating synthetic networks of infrastructures and ICIs will be developed, and generated benchmarks will be disseminated. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Outcomes of this work will facilitate such tasks as simulation, policy testing and decision making for ICIs enabled by fundamental advancement in network generation algorithms. The toolbox will be designed using a modular approach that will allow it to evolve and to be applied in other domains. The interdisciplinary team of investigators comprising expertise in computer science, behavioral science, civil engineering, and network science and public health will ideally support the goal of realistic synthetic data generation. Perspectives and methodological approaches from network analysis, big data systems, machine learning, water networks, and organizational sciences will be brought to bear to develop a toolkit of methods that include a combination of network analytics, optimization, and statistical analysis techniques. The resulting products will include developed algorithms and generated synthetic datasets disseminated for a broad scientific community.</AbstractNarration>

<POR_COPY_TXT><![CDATA[ The main outcome of the last year is a comination of physical parameter optimization and generated planar topology of the network. As a result we obtained a scalable nearly linear time pipeline to generate a realistic water network structure given a single example of the original network. We are currently in the process of running our pipeline hundreds of times to generate various realistic water network structures for broad scientific audience.  In this step of the pipeline the goal was to convert the generated simple graph into a physically feasible water distribution system. In this process we rely on the original network Information and various specific characteristics that are often found in WDSs such as the location of tanks and reservoirs and allocation of pumps to finalize the water network.   Specifically, the following characteristics were taken into account  1. Assigning coordinates. This is the first step in the generation of WDS from a planar topology. Although the generated topology is planar, embedding it in 2D space is NP hard problem, we use existing force-directed algorithms such as Forceatlas2 to generate 2D representation of the generated planar graph.  2. Defining tanks. Tanks play a significant role in the WDS design and operation. Using tanks storage capability, the WDSs design to be redundant, resourceful, and reliable in case of contingencies. In our model we assign tanks by first dividing the network into clusters such that they mimic the real-world WDS.  3. Reservoirs. Reservoirs represent the unlimited source that provide the network with water. In order to assume that the generated water network is a potential valid network, it must have at-least one reservoir/ tank. In case the generated network is re-scaled such that it is larger than the original network then we increase the number of reservoirs by the rescaling factor.  4. Junctions. Junctions will denote the network demand nodes which WDS need to satisfy.  After the Reservoirs and Tanks are assigned we label the remaining nodes in the graph as junctions. In our generation model, we assign values for junction parameters such as demand and elevation is based on original input water network, which acts as the base values.  5. Pumps. Pumps are essential component to keep the WDS functional by providing the adequate amount of energy needed for WDS operation. An important property typically found in real world water networks is that the pumps are often located near the supply nodes such as reservoirs and tanks. Our generator replicates this property by utilizing the same recursive partitioning as used for assigning tanks and assigning pumps by selecting edges in a partition which has a tank or reservoir, thus guaranteeing the location of pumps is near the tanks.  6. Pipes. Pipes are the veins of the WDSs that carry water through the network. After we assign pumps, the remaining edges in the graph are labeled as pipes. The assign base values based on original input network but can also be provided as user input for pipe parameters Length, Diameter, Roughness, Minor Loss and Status. We optimize pipe diameter later using genetic optimization solver discussed in next section.  After introducing all these characteristics we optimize the entire network.
