# DataAnalysis_NSF_Grants

Hi! The motivation for this analysis was to use the data from the National Science Foundation website to inform researchers on what topic of research are in demand.

The questions to ask were, what areas of research are most sought-after? Among those topics, which offer the most funding? 

To conduct this project, I counted the frequency of research topics in the title and abstract section of the data and calculated the corresponding funding amount.


* **TASK_SUMMARY** 

  **Data Extraction:** The website text files were written in an XML file format, which had to be parsed and converted into a readable and workable dataframe.

   **Data Cleaning:** Next was data cleaning.Â 
   1. The data needed to remove any missing values. 
   2. I filitered non-research-related awards. 
   3. I remove stop words. 
   4. Removed additional irrelevant words
